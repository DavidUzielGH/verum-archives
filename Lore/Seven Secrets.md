# Seven Secrets

This is a transcription of the 7 Secrets Stream. A reward for the community for allowing Arcadum to reach 7777 subscribers on his [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/arcadum) channel.

It was streamed on July 7th at 7:00 p.m. 2020.

The following documents Arcadum’s words from the beginning of the stream to the end of the secrets. This is word for word, rambling and all.

This has also been posted to the subreddit on its own for the sake of easier discussion: [7 Secrets Stream](https://redd.it/hndoy6).

## Introduction

> **Arcadum**: Hello. The time has come. You have paid a heavy price, and now you shall be justly rewarded. And so, it begins.

Mysterious ambient music begins to play.

## The First Secret

> **Arcadum**: The first secret that I have to reveal to you are the laws that govern the entirety of the universe. This is not just the planet of Verum itself, but through the entirety of the setting. There are a set of laws that do such a thing, and there are seven of them.
>
> They are called covenants. They represent the promise that Death made to Life at the beginning of all creation. The dichotomy of such a beginning is that in the beginning there was only Death and it was alone. And in the shadowy dark of entropy it felt nothing, it was nothing, and it was sorrowful--until, as is with most things, Life came to be. Conjured out of seemingly nothing, erupted from a seed unseen. It began to grow and with its bright light it began to twist and gnarl, like the roots of a great tree, and as such Death began to love Life and became its greatest guardian. But Life was fickle and chaotic and it would grow and twist in harmful ways so, for the good of all Death took his modern place as most know of him today. Not as a person, or even a deity, but as an inevitability. All things that begin must also end.
>
> And to ensure that never could his power be misused Death made seven promises to Life which formed into great covenants. They are the covenants of life, of time, of wisdom, ambition, dream, death, and a seventh promise One that has since been lost to the Reckoning. It is not known whether or not Death still keeps this covenant or whether its shattering has something to do with it, but in either case, only six covenants yet remain and the final one still yet remains broken.
>
> And that is your first secret.

## The Second Secret

> **Arcadum**: The second secret that I have to reveal to you is the truth behind arcane magic on Verum. It is not known as to how the synthetic pillar yet retains its shape, but it is known of the cost to make it do so. For in the beginning magic was wild and untamed. The laws that govern the realm of Verum was- was ephemeral, unknown. The Sage of Nine Paths wrote down the sacred ways and taught such things to those that would listen. For the Sage’s gifts were wasted as ambition and greed took hold and the Elven empire grew from the world seed, and as such, the laws were broken, magic was not respected, and in the great Scarab War, the land of Majital paid the first price. The land was drained of life and became naught but a fallow desert. It was then, however, that an unknown sacrifice would be made from an unlikely place, for the Gnomes of Kalkatesh, living between dream and the waking realm, decided that since they would pay the least cost to go to where they belong, to die, the gnomes performed the great exodus, which while doing so, they sacrificed their waking realm, their life, to reenter the dream realm. This act, forged with power so great that it kindled the flame of arcane energy, and as such, the damage to the leylines was lessened and now wizards may cast unabated and undeterred.

> That is your second secret.

## The Third Secret

> **Arcadum**: The third secret has to deal with the worlds before. For Verum is not the first, it is the sixth. Five times hence the entire realm has been destroyed. Five times hence have they been forgotten and forged. However, The Enemy, powerful as it is, has a curious concept, for all things must be done in the proper order, and as such, although these realms are destroyed, their people dead, their cultures lost, The Enemy has kept trophies, reminders, grim promises of what yet awaits Verum should they fail. And these take the form of the Obituary Towers which float in the plains beyond, just on the edge of the nebulae. It is within these towers that the fragments of the worlds destroyed yet still linger, no more than a whisper, no less than a shadow.

> And that is your third secret.

## The Fourth Secret

> **Arcadum**: The next secret is the explanation as to why a soul refracts. Why is it that some souls disperse, change, are malleable, and can find their way into different bodies? One might attach it that the soul is being controlled directly from some unforeseen force, some alternate entity, but that is not the case, at least to the eyes of those that live in it. For the truth is that courage and heroism are not intangible. They are not ideals, so much as they are representations of the will of Life, and whenever the capacity that the Lifestream has allotted to each little branch is exceeded, that branch grows fruit, and that fruit is courage, heroism, and power. And once the fruit is ripened, it refracts, and a new branch is made, and the tree is made stronger, and Death keeps ever track of just how much there is.
>
> And that is the fourth secret.

## The Fifth Secret

> **Arcadum**: The next secret deals with the Shattered Gate and why it has such a name. The Lifestream has a singular point, a convergence. It is not clear as to whether or not it is where the seed of life was planted, or perhaps even through the coiling roots that this is merely the trunk. What is clear, however, is that the Gate represents this convergence, where all life flows through a singular point, and such a place is watched over by Inu and his Weavers. As such, the Gate has become shattered, broken, twisted by the constant strain of the lifestream dealing with the conflicts of itself, and also with the shattering of the first covenant. Inu and his Weavers do what they can to reweave the lifestream, but should the Gate be destroyed, it will be the beginning of the end. Just as all the worlds before it have been destroyed, so too does the strain of all life twist and pressure what little remains of the Gate.
>
> And that is your fifth secret.

## The Sixth Secret

> **Arcadum**: The next secret deals with while some believe that there are gods of death, but whom is true Death? The answer to that question is that they are the same. For each god of death is a reaper, a reaper that serves Lord Death, the one above all, the guardian of Life, and as such, Lorn, Aladine, and others serve as his horsemen, as his first line of defense against stagnation, undue entropy, and sickness of the Tree of Life.

> And that is your sixth secret.

## The Seventh Secret

There is a pause as Arcadum puts up his hood.

> **Arcadum**: And so, the last secret that I will reveal today.

Lumina begins to play.

> **Arcadum**: You know of The Herald, but whom does the Herald serve? For the great threat that looms within the sky is not the being that The Seven fought all those years ago. It is instead merely a promise, a promise of something greater, of the true enemy that walks in shadow and in forgotten, shattered memories. But the fragments return, the pieces fall into place, and bit by bit, the great cosmic web ravels to a singular point, for when the Herald reaches Kalkatesh, and its violet light shines like a second sun, that is when you will see it. That is when the fate of all will be decided once more. The great wheel will turn, and it must be stopped. The final stand will be made and the cost will be paid again. Such is the way. However, perhaps the process may be stopped. The great wheel may yet not turn. But how? How can such things be stopped? How can the duty of The Seven be rescinded and made unnecessary and how can the enemy finally be destroyed?
>
> The answer to that secret lies within each and every single one of you, for the secret that I reveal, finally, is something that you already know, for I have already told you what to do. In each campaign, since Trouble in Trisden, don’t count that one, that was a test. I have put the answer into every campaign, hidden within the words I use, within the episodes, within the enemies fought, within the actions of the players. With each errant word a message that if unraveled you may yet see what the true ending can be, but if you cannot, then we have to hope that the blood of heroes, the blood of The Seven will be sufficient to stop the wheel and reset it again.
>
> I wish you luck, heroes of Kalkatesh, and the ephemeral spirits that watch, because I will be waiting for the answer.

> And that is your seventh secret.
