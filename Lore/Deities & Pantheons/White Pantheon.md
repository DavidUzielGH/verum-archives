# White Pantheon

This pantheon is for those deities that hold domain over the Good alignments.

## Glory

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

**Q:** What race is Glory?<br>
**A:** Glory is a race that has not been revealed yet, at least before his ascension.

Glory's rival is Crowley, and to a lesser extent Astaroth.


Glory is not a big believer in redemption, Glory believes there are some crimes that can't be forgiven. That's not to say he doesn't believe in redemption, he's just not the god of it, Vavren is.


**Q:** How does Glory feel about the rest of the White Pantheon? As well as the other Pantheons?<br>
**A:** Glory respects Runethares, he, like all, pays tribute to the Seven, he thinks Vavren is naive, and he thinks Viderick is useless.

Glory has mixed feelings about neutrality, and doesn't like the Black Pantheon. Now the Blue Pantheon is interesting, as it's a step closer to mortal kind than the others, and it's hodge podge of feelings. We'll really have to go over them as we come to them.


Glory respects the Green Pantheon, because while they don't outrank anyone they are the oldest Pantheon.

While they are by no means enemies, Glory and Iass are considered rivals.


## Runethares

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Runethares has his closest relationship with Raquel.


**Q:** What is Runethares's opinion on the other dragon races?<br>
**A:** He views them as lost children that he hopes they can come back into the fold. All dragons are an old race and there are aspects of their history that would be lost if they are lost.

Oloken'hai is Runethares's main enemy and greatest rival. Basically his nemesis.

**Q:** What are Runetharesâ€™s opinions on the knowledge that Oloken'hai hordes? Is it something best forgotten, or is even that shit worth preserving?<br>
**A:** Runethares believes all knowledge is worth preserving, that doesn't necessarily mean that all people are ready for all knowledge.

Runethares is older than Ezokhine.

**Q:** Does he/is he able to hide knowledge from other deities?<br>
**A:** No, but he does not tell them unless they ask. He is not the god of Secrets.


Runethares and Wondox are pretty good friends. He understands the value of a secret.

**Q:** What does Runethares think about the rest of the white pantheon?<br>
**A:** He believes Glory is necessary, but uncouth to some degree. Respects the Seven as all deities do. Thinks that Vavren is a tragic soul, and believes in what he believes in. Has a quiet unspoken respect for Viderick.


In the early days of Runethares development his clerics had the ability to see through the eyes of the past, so kind of like a form of time travel. He could tap into the pasts of these people, and live through the eyes of these individuals to learn about history. This is where his relationship with Raquel comes from.


Runethares does not believe that the future is preordained, even if it does repeat itself. Hence the eternal circle.


## The Seven

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

**Q:** Why White Pantheon?<br>
**A:** Calculated the alignment of all 7Y7D players, then chose the alignment that they leaned the most towards, they leaned good, hence the White Pantheon.

Too powerful to be placed in Blue

There are 539 Seven.

**Q:** Why do the other deities pay them homage?<br>
**A:** Fought for all of creation during the reckoning, and saved them. Brought hope back to creation, as such everyone pays them homage.

**Q:** How do the evil-aligned Seven characters feel about being placed in the White pantheon rather than the other pantheons?<br>
**A:** They don't feel anything, and I can't answer more than that.

The Seven are more of a concept. They are not a traditional deity, they are something else entirely.


**Q:** How different would the world have been for us if The Seven had been Black Pantheon?<br>
**A:** It would have been Warhammer 40.

No creature hates (pauses to think)... No creature that anyone knows about hates the Seven.

**Q:** What about the eight?<br>
**A:** The Eight is another concept that won't be relevant for a very very long time, if ever.


## Vavren

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

(Pronounced "vay-ren")

**Q:** What does Vavren think about beings such as Wode and Astaroth?<br>
**A:** So Vavren is a remnant of another world that was heavily affected by the Reckoning, and as such, Vavren has a deep understanding of just how far someone can go and then come back. So, Vavren is focused on the fact that it doesn't matter how evil something is, it can always be redeemed. There are some that are irredeemable, but nobody here is ever going to reach that level, it's just not going to happen.

He understands that not all those that are evil are there because they choose to be, and not all that are good started that way. Vavren is a very cool deity, because he's the Silent Watcher over the souls of mortals.

**Q:** So he's a people are born with sin kind of guy?<br>
**A:** No he is not. The world is too complex and varied to never do something wrong.

Vavren is a deity that was formed out of a great, terrible, trial, where horrible things had happened, with the understanding that no matter how bad your crimes are, you are not without chance to make things right. So, specifically, Vavren is sad because that means that most people that do these things are oftentimes punished. For example the reason why he's such a sad character, and why his temples are so worn, is that most that turn to good don't survive it. Like the Orc that has raided his entire life, that feels guilty for killing a caravan full of innocent people for no other reason than to steal their food, goes before the courts seeking redemption, and is killed for his crimes. Vavren watches over his soul, and calls it to the Ruined Shrine.

Vavren is very much a god of the cruel reality of what good actually means, and that it's never clear. That's why his shrine is ruined, because good isn't pure to Vavren. Good is something that is dirty and smudged, and that only with polish can it begin to shine.


**Q:** So shrines to Vavren able to be made in even the darkest moments/places?<br>
**A:** That's exactly where they are. Cool thing about the Badlands is that's where most of his shrines are, because that's where most dark beings are. There's a place of power in the Badlands that's a convex of Wendigoism, it's basically the grounds in which all Wendigos arrive in order to mate and plan and do all this other shit, it's a horrible place. But what most people don't realize is that that entire place is built atop a singular shrine of Vavren, that every time Wendigos goes there he slowly feeds off them and tries to get them to turn from being a Wendigo.

In fact, that's originally what the Wendigo Soul Badlands origin was originating. Is that Vavren slowly started turning Wendigos back to their human form.

Another thing that makes Vavren kind of sad is that he's oftentimes seen as a failure of a deity, because many people believe redemption is something that actually has to occur, but that's not what Vavren is about. He's not about completing redemption, he's about the thought of redemption, because many are unable to redeem themselves. Many are lost to their evil and they are tortured souls because of it, but that's why Vavren doesn't speak, he is the Silent Watcher.

Another reason Vavren is followed by monks is because monks believe in self improvement, but for one to believe in self improvement one has to believe that you are inefficient, you are not good enough, and that's what most monastery's begin with, is that someone who has not had appropriate training is flawed, and so they must become better, so they naturally follow Vavren pretty easily.

That's why Vavren is the patron of monks. I actually planned to create, in the future, a path for Monks.

**Q:** Does Vavren have the ability to speak?<br>
**A:** He does, he just chooses not to.


Most creatures that worship Vavren in the Badlands don't realize they're worshipping him. Every creature in the Badlands, because there are so many shrines to Vavren, has a slight pull away from darkness. That's why the Badlands haven't overwhelmed Orde, or infected the Khaoan jungles, or infected the sea to the south. There's always a little Jiminy Cricket in the back of their mind, just slowly pulling them back, just a little bit. Just enough that the Badlands doesn't spill out all over everything.

Also worshipped in Krazax, where Vavren is revered as one of the higher gods.

## Viderick

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Viderick and Vavren are often times as seen as rivals. Viderick is dealing with the situation, Vavren is what comes after, that's why Viderick is Sorrow and not Vavren.

Viderick is called the martyr because Viderick does not believe in avoiding loss. In fact, Viderick often times suggests that loss is just as important as love.

**Q:** How Viderick feels about children and specifically Lorita.<br>
**A:** So, Viderick is almost always weeping, and one of the reasons that he is is because of Lorita. Now, while Viderick does not consider Lorita to be his enemy, she is his antithesis. So in terms of the great cosmological scale, she is his opposite, because Lorita is the god of rage, which is the inability to accept what was lost, what was loved.

The reasons they are tied to orphans is because there are two sides to that particular brand of misery, and that is that some orphans accept that they weren't loved, and can find their own love, some can't and a seed of rage is planted inside of them. That rage can turn to ambition, to evil, it could turn into anything. Those two are very often at odds with one another.

Viderick has always viewed Lorita as his child, even though that isn't accurate. Lorita thinks he's weak, basically thinks she's a giant beta male.

**Q:** Viderick and resurrection?<br>
**A:** Resurrection is something Viderick is okay with. Just like he's okay with conjuring a soul, and making a child between same sex couples, because he believes that love can overpower loss, just like loss can overpower love. They're two equal forces and sometimes one wins over the other, they're constantly vying for strength. So if somebody loved somebody who died enough they can bring them back. Same thing, that if they loved each other enough they can have a child.  

Viderick has the ability to create a soul, which is something that is a big deal.

**Q:** What is Videricks opinion on charms and love potions?<br>
**A:** Compulsed love, and false affection are not what Viderick are about, that is the realm of Babylon. He doesn't like it, but it's not a blasphemy.
