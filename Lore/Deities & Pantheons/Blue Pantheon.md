# Blue Pantheon

This pantheon is for the deities that hold domain over a specific race (e.g. Human, Halfling, Dwarf, etc).

## Astaroth

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Dwarves

## Cassius

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Humans

Cassius is good friends with Tilt, as Halfings and Humans have been friends since the creation of Halflings.

## Falaael

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Elves?

Cassius is kind of against what Falaael believes. He doesnâ€™t like Kaheeli, he respects Runethares. He and Astarosh are not friends.

## Raquel

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: Time, (TBD)
* Domain Race: Gnomes

Tries to be on good terms with everyone.

## Tilt

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Halflings?

House on the Hill is always where Tilt is from.
