# Blue Pantheon

This pantheon is for the deities that hold domain over a specific race (e.g. Human, Halfling, Dwarf, etc).

## Astaroth

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Dwarves

## Cassius

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Humans

Cassius is good friends with Tilt, as Halfings and Humans have been friends since the creation of Halflings.

## Falaael

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)
* Domain Race: Elves?

Cassius is kind of against what Falaael believes. He doesnâ€™t like Kaheeli, he respects Runethares. He and Astarosh are not friends.

## Raquel

* Domains: Time, (TBD)
* Domain Race: Gnomes

Tries to be on good terms with everyone.

## Tilt

House on the Hill is always where Tilt is from.

## Tomen

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: Reflection, Knowledge, Balance
* Domain Race: Changelings
* Divine Symbols and Sigils: Twin Silver Serpents
* Alignment: Neutral
* Current Residence: The Mirrored Realm

To reflect is a state of being, the reality of two and the dichotomy of existence in both the real and mirrored, the past and future. Tomen holds dominion over this concept and indeed, in his actions protects the barrier between the two. Tomen was the first changeling and, due to the cursed method, the only male. His people doomed to die, Tomen, made a deal with the Hagmother, that she would give his people a chance to live, in exchange for the calling. The Hagmother believed that she would win in the end, but she was deceived, for the mirror has two faces, Tomen, dealt with Wode and Oun, and gave them his strength so that the dream would be a place where reflection was paramount and the Hagmother could never gain dominion.

Now Tomen serves as a guide to his sisters and hopes that one day, his people may yet be free from his first desperate act.
