# Black Pantheon

This pantheon is for those deities that hold domain over the evil alignments.

## Babylon

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Babylon has relationships with every other god.


**Q:** What does he think about Vavren?<br>
**A:** Vavren is the only deity that Babylon owes. The only debt that Babylon has is to Vavren, that's why his avatar is a crow. I can't tell you what their deal was, but I can tell you this: Babylon probably respects Vavren more than any of the other White Pantheon gods, perhaps more than any god. Babylon is cynical, he doesn't believe in good, with only one saving grace, and that is Vavren. Babylon is bound to Vavren, because he owes him but Vavren will never collect. Because it is said that Vavren will only consider the debt forgiven when Babylon redeems himself, and Babylon has pleaded to Vavren to allow him to pay another way, and he never has. So the only time the Devil will be out of debt is when he isn't the Devil anymore.


Avatar is a crow out of respect for Vavren.

It is rumored by clerics that Babylon feels no guilt, except that he cannot complete his deal with Vavren.

## Oloken'hai

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Views other gods with disdain.

Old One is closest Warlock patron to Oloken'hai.

The rest of the black pantheon views Oloken'hai with disdain.

Both Wode and Oloken'hai have the dark truth, connection there that can't be talked about right now.


## Wode

* Known Aliases: Father Fear, (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Fear is the greatest teacher that mankind has.

**Q:** Do Gods dream?<br>
**A:** Yes they do.


## Lorita

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: Rage, Orphans, (Flame?, TBD)

**Q:** Is the Crow motif related to Vavren? Babylon? Other?<br>
**A:** What is Vavren the god of, and what is Lorita? Think about it, why do you think the crow's there?


## Crowley

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Crowley was created when the Sheet of the Legion was captured from Kingvale by the heroes of phase 1.

Elaka is the Eldari word for warrior.
