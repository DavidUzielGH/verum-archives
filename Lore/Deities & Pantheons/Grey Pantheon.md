# Grey Pantheon

This pantheon is for those deities that hold domain over ___

## Iass

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Iass is top 3 most popular 7Y7D gods.

Iass is not Just, she is Fair.


**Q:** Iass is all about fairness, and in the Library of Kacael, Babylon had to give people a fair chance because of Iass, is it normal for her to interject in a gods business if it isn't a fair challenge?<br>
**A:** So now I get to talk about why the power level scale is deceptive between the pantheons. So, in the tree of strength, it's the white pantheon and black pantheon, they are the strongest in their dominion, but they are also the most rigid in their dominion. They are the big halves, the driving forces, the grey pantheon is weaker than them, but the grey pantheon can intervene between the two, it is a miasma of variance between that decides to between the white and black to gain more power over the other in the constant Yin and Yang struggle, and to a lesser extent you have the green pantheon in the center that makes sure all things are balanced in terms of the old ways, and the blue pantheon that represents the closest step to mortal kind.

Point is the Grey pantheon has deities that are most likely to directly intervene with the plans of the other pantheons.

That's why Iass will get involved when Babylon is trying to set people up.


But the reason why the Seven like her so much is because in 7Y7D, when they fought something that was beyond their strength, she assured them that they were properly rewarded.


## Kaheeli

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

The goddess of the waves that keeps out, with the assistance of the Leviathans, the olds ones that are constantly trying to seep their way through and push against the great covenant.

(I know there's not much here, there was just a lot of talking about storms and sailors, and I didn't view that as worth writing. (sorry Arcadum))


## Oun

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Whenever someone dies or dreams they go to the Dream realm, which is also the spirit realm in Verum.

Oun and Wode are the most detached deities, as they only exist in the spirit realm.

Fear is the oldest emotion (could be clerical interpretation and not truth)

## Sekelcuse

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Sekelcuse stole luck from the god of luck, and that god lost its power and faded from history.

>Cloak of night, Sharp of mind<br>
All gathered here, recite this rhyme<br>
A neighbor neglected, leaves your home unprotected.<br>
Hunger, thirst and need, spread from you and me.<br>
Take from the bloated and the wicked, give to those in need.<br>
This is my first rule, one of charity.<br>
<br>
Luck is fickle, skill is not<br>
A trail is blazed, by those that never stop<br>
Fear not a helping hand, Luck will help you have a shot.<br>
Perseverance prevails, the second rule I've got.<br>
<br>
Words are tools, use them well.<br>
Instead of blade, a lie to tell.<br>
Avoid thee then, a broken deal<br>
My third rule is caution, your word is your seal.<br>
<br>
Heed thee now my final rule.<br>
Blades of two, my rarest tools.<br>
Pay your debts, drink deep of life.<br>
Some however, are paid twice.<br>
Cloak of night, Sharp of mind<br>
Be careful now and you'll be fine.

Respect for Vavren, doesn't steal from him because he's poor and doesn't have anything to steal. Doesn't like the Matron of Fate, represents predestination and therefore incompatible with Sekelcuse.

## Wondox

* Known Aliases: (Keeper of Secrets?, TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Wondox and Oloken'hai are enemies, because Oloken'hai believes that Wondox holds the Dark Truth that he seeks, and if that secret is revealed then he will finally ascend past what he is.

**Q:** What's the Coven's relationship with Wondox?<br>
**A:** They are on friendly terms right now, specifically because the Patrons are of the same kin as Wondox in that their powers and true forms are secret, so they're kind of on the same team in that sense.

## Ezokhine

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

Friendly rivalry to Astaroth as they are both of the forge, friendly disposition to Runethares. No real enemies.

Ezokhine and Vavren are close, in the sense that one man's trash is another man's treasure. Slight distinctions between the two.

## Matron of Fate

* Known Aliases: (TBD)
* Domains: (TBD)

No enemies, Cassius probably resists her the most, and dislikes her second only to dragons.

First Weaver means she was the first servant of Inu.
