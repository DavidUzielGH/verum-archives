# Sevenic Speeches

These are special monologues Arcadum himself, as the DM, gives to players of his games to present a large bit of lore and/or story based on a significant action or decision a player or group has made.

They are so-called "Sevenic" as they typically appeear in session seven of any given campaign (or a multiple of seven). Also the song he chooses to play during these speeches is often called "The Song of The Seven".

The song itself is actually entitled "Lumina". You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtR9_E-O2w8), but really you should listen to it in context of the below speeches.

The magic of this song and Arcadum's speeches is how well timed they are with the song.<br>
(HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT <img src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5f30e449fe85fb4472d27fcc/1x" alt="DESKCHAN" /> (but we know he will ðŸ˜‰))

If you've not experienced one before, it's highly recommended you pick the campaign you're most familiar with and watch the speech within.
