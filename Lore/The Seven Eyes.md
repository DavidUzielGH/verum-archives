# The Seven Eyes

The seven eyes refers to the characters in the world of Verum that have had one of their eyes "touched", cursed, affected by Violet light in some way and end up with a seven-pointed star appear their pupil.

It is said this is the same power that The Seven themselves once wielded and grants the bearer of the Eye to see differently when viewing the world through it.

However, the danger of this Eye is that because it is tied to the Violet, The Enemy, for whom all Violet bends to its will, can also take advantage and see through this Eye as well.
