# Moe's Visions
Moe Cowbull, through various means (and time shenanigans) gained a 3rd eye. A Cyclopean eye. This eye allows him to see time as a circle. Past, present, and future all at once.

At times he uses this ability to look at certain people and by doing so is granted a vision of this person's life. Below are the various visions he has seen.

## Ives Brightburn
(Heart of Tyre -- Session 5)

>(Thanks, Canna).
>
> Ives past.
Is like a hateful dream
A mixture of sadness, death, bad decisions, broken promises
And deep regrets.
But all of that blows away.
Autumn leaves turn to spring.
And it if the future you see instead.

> Ives stands on a dark precipice. Looking out at a kaleidoscopic landscape.
Fractured.
Covered in many scars.
Has a strange regalia on
An armor and robes
Looking more like a Kensei
The bow he wields
Is a bow of black and white feathers with twin wolves in the center
And tied around it
Are two symbols
The Symbol of the Tops
And the Symbol of the Pirate Hat
His face is grim
Tears no longer stain his cheeks
His visage changes to a dark scowl
For across the kaleidoscopic reach
On a great disk
Stands the great wizard Tyre.

> Ives’s circle has only just begun.

> “This is the beginning, not the end.”
