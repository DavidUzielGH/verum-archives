# Moe's Visions
Moe Cowbull, through various means (and time shenanigans) gained a 3rd eye. A Cyclopean eye. This eye allows him to see time as a circle. Past, present, and future all at once.

At times he uses this ability to look at certain people and by doing so is granted a vision of this person's life. Below are the various visions he has seen.

## Ives Brightburn
(Heart of Tyre -- Session 5)

>(Thanks, Canna).
>
> Ives past.
Is like a hateful dream
A mixture of sadness, death, bad decisions, broken promises
And deep regrets.
But all of that blows away.
Autumn leaves turn to spring.
And it if the future you see instead.
>
> Ives stands on a dark precipice. Looking out at a kaleidoscopic landscape.
Fractured.
Covered in many scars.
Has a strange regalia on
An armor and robes
Looking more like a Kensei
The bow he wields
Is a bow of black and white feathers with twin wolves in the center
And tied around it
Are two symbols
The Symbol of the Tops
And the Symbol of the Pirate Hat
His face is grim
Tears no longer stain his cheeks
His visage changes to a dark scowl
For across the kaleidoscopic reach
On a great disk
Stands the great wizard Tyre.

> Ives’s circle has only just begun.

> “This is the beginning, not the end.”

## Mirage

(Shadow of Tyre -- Session 16)

> ***Moe** cyclops eyes Mirage<br>
> **Arcadum**: The first thing that you notice is that, strangely, she is bright and difficult to look at. She thrums with so much of the lifestream, as she's kind of wading through a river of it constantly. You see images of her past, present, and future.<br>
In the past you can see images of her dancing with her sisters in Majital, gathering wayward travelers from the road, and feeding off of their happiness before they perish from normal means.<br>
...She stands with Inu and the lifestream, she sings one of the four chords, the chord of Freedom.<br>
Future. You see the infinite waves, deep, deep beneath them. The heavy waters, the dark abysses, and then you see her, singing with two others whose faces are obscured. And a being deep below that should be kept sleeping awakens instead.

The statement is that Moe thinks the being should be kept asleep. Dangerous at the very least.
