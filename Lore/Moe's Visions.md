# Moe's Visions
Moe Cowbull, through various means (and time shenanigans) gained a 3rd eye. A Cyclopean eye. This eye allows him to see time as a circle. Past, present, and future all at once.

At times he uses this ability to look at certain people and by doing so is granted a vision of this person's life. Below are the various visions he has seen.

## Ives Brightburn
(Heart of Tyre -- Session 5)

>(Thanks, Canna).
>
> Ives past.
Is like a hateful dream
A mixture of sadness, death, bad decisions, broken promises
And deep regrets.
But all of that blows away.
Autumn leaves turn to spring.
And it if the future you see instead.
>
> Ives stands on a dark precipice. Looking out at a kaleidoscopic landscape.
Fractured.
Covered in many scars.
Has a strange regalia on
An armor and robes
Looking more like a Kensei
The bow he wields
Is a bow of black and white feathers with twin wolves in the center
And tied around it
Are two symbols
The Symbol of the Tops
And the Symbol of the Pirate Hat
His face is grim
Tears no longer stain his cheeks
His visage changes to a dark scowl
For across the kaleidoscopic reach
On a great disk
Stands the great wizard Tyre.

> Ives’s circle has only just begun.

## Mirage

(Shadow of Tyre -- Session 16)

> ***Moe** cyclops eyes Mirage<br>
> **Arcadum**: The first thing that you notice is that, strangely, she is bright and difficult to look at. She thrums with so much of the lifestream, as she's kind of wading through a river of it constantly. You see images of her past, present, and future.<br>
In the past you can see images of her dancing with her sisters in Majital, gathering wayward travelers from the road, and feeding off of their happiness before they perish from normal means.<br>
...She stands with Inu and the lifestream, she sings one of the four chords, the chord of Freedom.<br>
Future. You see the infinite waves, deep, deep beneath them. The heavy waters, the dark abysses, and then you see her, singing with two others whose faces are obscured. And a being deep below that should be kept sleeping awakens instead.

The statement is that Moe thinks the being should be kept asleep. Dangerous at the very least.

## Grimnir

Grimnir is one of Ster's refractions, seen through Erin(?).

> **Grimnir**: Ragnarok is upon us. We tried to find our way. But we were lost. The world serpents consume and eat. And the guardian of your world fails. The light of The Herald burns the sky. But there is yet hope. Although their people have faded and failed and the islands have fallen, there still yet beats the drums of war and the heart of Yggdrasil still burns. Seek Odin.

Arcadum then states the "final" secret of the cyclops:

> **Arcadum**: The cyclops can view time in a circle - but more importantly that means those who possess the sight are among the only beings who can both see and speak to refractions. Someone actually interacting and conversing with a refraction has not happened until now. With practice it is inferred Moe could select a refraction at will and summon it to communicate.

Moe then attempts to contact Gruff (one of Ster's refractions) and later confirms that Gruff was fully aware of the conversation.

Moe goes on to pray to Odin in an attempt to summon him, and Odin himself arrives on a spectral ship, accompanied by others who are implied to be

Of the NPCs who disembark Odin's ship:
* Wild Red Haired Woman with Bow and Knife: Most closely describes Skadi
* Man with Winged Helmet and Hammer: Clearly Thor
* Kindly Man with Nice Face and Friendly Disposition: Possibly Baldr
* Shifty Individual: Clearly Loki

An exchange takes place between Odin and Moe. Moe Cowbull is able to see Odin fully (with Cyclops sight) and this includes seeing Odin over the course of "the history of Yggdrasil," learning that Odin was the First Cyclops. (Unclear if this Yggdrasil is the same Tree Of Life as we know it in the 6th World). It is plainly stated that the Cyclops were birthed from Odin losing his eye in battle against the giants. The Eye was covered in earth, water, and fire to form into "the first" [Cyclops].

The rest is a transcription of this exchange:

> **Moe**: I was informed by one named Grimnir that Ragnarok is upon us.<br>
**Odin**: I know of him. He drinks in Valhalla even now, awaiting his brother. Good lad, good with his mind, bad luck with bows.<br>
**Moe**: He informed me that the world serpents consume and eat and that the guardian of this world is failing. There is hope though...<br>
**Odin**: Yes, your Jörmungandr is growing weak, much as ours did - our attempt to save my people have led to more bloodshed and your *Kaheeli* is a stronger opponent than I ever could have imagined. Our battle has left us weakened. Would it be that I could see all things - but there is a limit to even my eye.<br>
***Odin** glances at The Herald comet visible in the sky.<br>
**Odin**: A strange thing it is, memory. In one hand it wields nothing. And in the other it is everything. One of your Seven freed me from my prison. Saved me from the tower. Hm...it was a difficult reality to know that my people had already lost.<br>
**Moe**: If you'll permit me Allfather - I believe there is still hope...<br>
***Moe** reveals 3rd eye.<br>
**Moe**: I have been gifted this by your children and I wish to fight for you.<br>
**Odin**: Your commitment and so quick of a meeting - is commendable. But would it be that we would take those followers again and their souls in this place upon my children and I. I have taken too much from this world and from the world before. I am not the same man that I once was. I...was taught humility in my prison. My people need a home. We know only to fight for what we want. And it would seem that perhaps hope is in short supply for my people. I hear their voices - they lament upon their ships, they grow weary and tired upon the beaches. Your Kalkatesh has proved not an easy target and it has earned my respect. But my desperation only grows. For my people must rest. They need homes and food. Our home has been destroyed.<br>
**Moe**:  I believe we have a common foe. Could it be that by uniting we can make a new home for all of us?<br>
**Odin**: And where would you suggest a new home be made exactly? What power do you have that can guarantee this? Who are you to speak with any authority Minotaur?<br>
**Moe**: My lord I am no one, but I started even less. Every step that I have taken has shown me more of the world that came before and I believe we will play an integral part of the world that will come after.<br>
**Odin**: Very well. If you wish to serve - first you must prove your worthiness. We do not accept the weak as our followers. Therefore, prove to me that you can provide a home for my people and you shall have Aegir at your side.<br>
**Moe**: I will do whatever must be done.<br>
**Odin**: So be it.

Odin sends Valkyries to guard the Camp.
