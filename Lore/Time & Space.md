# Time & Space

For both the accounting of the time systems in Verum and their relation to contemporary understandings. The various planets and nebula in the Astral Sea as well as the different planes of existence.

Given how large a factor time and its shattering has on the overall story of Verum that is discussed separately [here] (TBD).

## Keeping Time

Time of day is the same as you would expect it to be IRL. 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, etc.

However when it comes to the months of the year, the world of Verum and the continent of Kalkatesh especially has their own names for each:

| Verum Month | Contemporary Month |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Verza       | January            |
| Malto       | February           |
| Dailos      | March              |
| Valka       | April              |
| Haates      | May                |
| Azen        | June               |
| Rentoss     | July               |
| Band        | August             |
| Era         | September          |
| Kasaka      | October            |
| Feyvi       | November           |
| Prime       | December           |

## The Astral Sea

[<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/318605243959214080/745621335350313010/unknown.png" alt="The Astral Sea Map" height="250px" />](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/318605243959214080/745621335350313010/unknown.png)

The Verum way of referring to "outer space", but not a direct relation as Arcadum has interesting things going on out there, but it is a decent approximation.

Most of the information we have on the various planets comes from the token information revealed on the map during various campaign sessions. As such many of these descriptions may be from the former PF ruleset during 7Y7D campaigns and therefore may not be accurate.

Listed `Time Dialation` is assumed to be relative to the planet Verum and the nebula within which it resides.

For more specific notes on a particular planet click into the individual document for it (WIP).

### Central Nebula -- Verum

This is where the planet of Verum and the various planes of existence can be found.

Closest representation of Verum according to Arcadum's description:<br>
[<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709112342213820528/772650460712140800/verum_expanded.png" alt="Artist depiction of the planet Verum" height="250px" />](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709112342213820528/772650460712140800/verum_expanded.png)<br>
(Artist: [@yowto_](https://twitter.com/yowto_))<br>
Note that the continents form “cones”, in a sense. The depiction is such that the widest point of the cone is the surface, and it narrows as it approaches the center of the Planet.

#### Planes of Existence

The waking realm, also known as the "Prime Material Plane".<br>
The Shadowfell, believed to be Verum's moon, is the plane of existence representing death.<br>
The Feywild represents life.<br>
The remaining four planes are for the prime elements: Fire, Earth, Water, & Air.
