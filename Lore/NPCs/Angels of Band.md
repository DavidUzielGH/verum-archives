# The Angels of Band

Artificial intelligence treated as semi-deitic creatures by the more primitive peoples of the world.

(More info on the theory of how the AI were left behind as the people's devolved technologically and forgot what AI were)

## The Angels

The angels themselves are divided up into their own groups. Not exactly pantheons, but more like divisions of labor or domains in a more traditional deitic sense. But even domains are a bit of a misnomer as each Angel has their own area of responsibility.
