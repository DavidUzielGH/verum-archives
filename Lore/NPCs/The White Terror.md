# The White Terror

  	 
From Sean's [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cadum/comments/jhvn5o/background_lore_the_white_terror/) on The White Terror fight:

> The White Terror was a major boss in phase 2 of the Living World - a rogue Leviathan that was destroying ships in a rage instead of doing its duty of protecting the plane from extraplanar incursions. The Freemen and their allies were tasked with taking them down - 15 adventurers on 3 siege armed boats took to the sea to stop it.<br>
Once there they fought a pitched battle until it was weak enough for Kaheeli to seal it. However, it was discovered during the battle that it had knowledge of the Violet, and was actively being hunted by Odin and the Viakin. Kaheeli attempted to stop Odin, but was being utterly bested by the one eyed God. That is until Talven - a defector from the Viakin pantheon - intervened. Both sides retreated and this set up the war between Kalkatesh and the Viakin.
