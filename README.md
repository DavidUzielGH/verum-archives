# verum-archives
Collective resource for the lore in &amp; transcripts of Arcadum's DnD Campaigns.

## Introduction
Verum is a setting created by [Arcadum](https://twitch.tv/arcadum). A heavily homebrewed version of 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. It is what is described as a "living world". Multiple campaigns are conducted within this setting and all of them are concurrent with each other. Decisions, choices, actions, and consequences that befall one group can and do affect other campaigns and players.

The campaigns are divided up amongst two main categories:
 * The Stream Games - Those campaigns DM'd by Arcadum himself and featuring many a well known streamer or more recently celebrities who are intersted in playing DnD
 * The Living World Games - Those campaigns that are conducted in a major part as a text-based MMO on Arcadum's [Discord](https://discord.gg/verum), currently made up of nearly 300 players and over 25+ DMs.

## Lore

Lore is organized by campaign, as well as by general topics relevant to the universe of Verum.
Campaign specific lore is broken up into session files with general transcripts as well as specific important lore excerpts of a particular episode.
