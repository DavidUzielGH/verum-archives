Koordrin is first and foremost a warrior, using his monstrous strength granted by his heritage as a Minotaur to fight in Cassius's honor, and to assist his allies. Koordrin is devote and focused, always the one to remind the party of their goal, and to keep them on track when whatever situation they find themselves in is derailed. Despite his intimidating and commanding appearance, Koordrin is of a simpler mind, compared to some adventurers. He seeks to serve Cassius, savior of the Minotaurs, and to stand against all that would oppose Cassius or the other goodly gods. Koordrin has his goals, and he tries his best not to let anything, or anyone, get in the way of them.
