Gruff had a small family of a Wife and Son until the divine intervention of the Gods entered his life. He was in his biggest noodling tournament yet when he spoke an earnest prayer to Gazenaroc to let him find the biggest fish anyone ever done seen - and he believes this wish was granted. He won this noodling tournament with a magnificent catch and from then on thought it was his divine purpose to wrangle the creatures of the deep. He continued on more fishing trips and tournaments that had him traveling all over the world. Eventually, he would find that he had no home to return to. His wife would leave him because he was never around and his son Chad would leave to the Bard's College to find himself. With nowhere to go he decided to travel to the Badlands to help establish Gailan's Gate and fish in Twilight Bay.
