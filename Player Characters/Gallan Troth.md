Gallan Troth is the epitome of the gentle giant. The powerful, towering build gifted to him from his ancestors isn't used to rush head first into enemies as most would expect, but instead to give firm and comforting hugs befitting a follower of Viderick, and to impose himself between his allies and the enemies that would do them harm. As a cleric of love and a follower of Viderick, Gallen travels west with the rest of his party in hopes of arriving in time to a marriage he's supposed to perform all the way in the region of Krazax, a goal that seems further and smaller with each passing day. Regardless, Gallan does his best to give relationship advice to those that need it when he can, and makes sure to enjoy every small comfort he comes across on the journey.
