Zacharius Aradhel fits the stereotype of bookish, weak, magic-using elf well, at least on the outside. In reality he is analytical, and takes any opportunity he can to get out of a sticky situation, which is ironically what got him into his current position in the first place. Zacharius was once an opportunistic gambler, learning how games worked and exploiting them to their fullest, a folly which he pays for with service to the Gambler Black as one of his warlocks. Despite the sinister boot Zacharius has on his neck, he tries to upkeep his principles where he can by respecting tradition and being upfront with his party about his darker doings, at least as much as they need to know to be satisfied. Zacharius moves west by the command of Gambler Black, tasked with taking trinkets and power to repay the Gambler Black, an ever-present reminder of Zacharius's more disquieting dealings.
