Mirage is a Siren borne of Majital's expansive deserts. She wears the gold-plated, dazzling armor of her homeland with pride, and greets others with a joy and friendliness as pure and bright as the desert sun itself. As a Harpy Siren, Mirage feeds off of the joy of others, so she tries to make people happy wherever she can, including through wooing them with her voice and the siren's song. However, despite Mirage's cheery demeanor, she holds within her a much more sinister rage, a rage fostered by the slaughter of her siren sisters at the hands of a man in red. Mirage travels west in hopes of finding this man and reaping vengeance for her sisters, seeking power and allies wherever she can find it to help her in this task.
