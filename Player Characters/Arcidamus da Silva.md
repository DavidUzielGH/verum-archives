Arcidamus da Silva is a seasoned adventurer and a retired sailor, with muscles and a head of silver hair to show for his experience. For his entire life, Arcidamus went wherever the wind took him, from taming the crashing, dangerous waters of the Abyssal Sea to starving in the scorching deserts of Majital. Arcidamus claims he should have died that day in Majital, if it weren't for the intervention of the Matron of Fate. In thanks to the Matron, Arcidamus became one of her clerics, going on to teach others of the complex workings of fate wherever he goes, explaining to anyone that will listen that they didn't just trip over that rock because they weren't looking where they were going, it was *fate*. Arcidamus moves west for one simple reason: the Matron told him to, and so it was fated.
