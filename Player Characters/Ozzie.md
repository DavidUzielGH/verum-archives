Always in search of gold and gems, Ozzie's thieving ways made him the ire of his fellow Aarakokra, and the shame of his honest parents. He left Dolten, in search of more illicit opportunities. He often used his druidic abilities to employ the aide of woodland creatures and urban vermin to assist him in his minor robberies through every city and town he stepped into.

## Backstory

After hearing a rumor of a great stash of wealth in an old noble's home in Orde, Ozzie set out to make it his own. Under the veil of darkness, he snuck into the treasure-promised mansion. He passed two small paintings. One was of an aging man with his wife and their two children. Another painting contained an even older man and the two children from before, who had also aged. This time, there was no wife.   Ozzie shook his head, "Poor sod." He pushed forward, and he found coffers filled to the brim with gold, jewels, and even magical tomes which he wasn't versed enough in arcana to recognize. As he stuffed his pockets, an old wizard burst open the door and began menacingly twirling his wand. Ozzie froze in anticipation of what was likely a devastating spell. He was certain that his uppance had come. However, no magic came. Instead, the old wizard clutched his chest and fell over.

Ozzie fled, his pockets only moderately filled. He ran up to one of the town guards and pointed towards the mansion, "I heard a scream from that darkly place, sir. I think some ol' codger's keeled o'er." The thief wisely kept himself beyond arm's length of the guard.   The guard responded, "Now you ain't done nothin' to him, right?" The guard then reached out to grab Ozzie by the wing, but Ozzie had already leapt into the air out of the guard's reach.

"I done nothin', sir. Only a good citizen tryna help!" With that, Ozzie flew away.   He guiltily counted his haul. It would be enough to get him about a month of luxurious boarding and meals, but he knew he couldn't keep this lifestyle up forever. He thought, "Maybe I can get a job. Be a proper fellow on the straight and narrow. Maybe that Gailen guy I heard about has got somethin' for me."

With that, he fled Orde and found his way to Gailen's Gate. He's not confident that he can completely abandon his sticky fingered nature, but he'll try.
