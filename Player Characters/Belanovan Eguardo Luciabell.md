Belanovan was born in the badlands, as such his family had nothing to their name. But, that didn't matter to Belanovan, as long as he had his family everything was fine in his heart. That was until his sister became ridden with a disease. Bela became very distraught and did everything he could to try and cure her, roaming the lands finding any doctor or information he could about the disease. But of course, he was poor, he had nothing to offer.

This grim situation pushed Bela into slight robbery to get money, but not to get money to pay for doctors, but to study and educate himself. Bela knew that he needed money to help his family out, especially his sister. But he did not want to stoop to the level of true criminals. He would scavenge and buy any books for knowledge and he eventually became interested in law and politics.

He would use this knowledge to help people with legal issues, for money of course. He would also practice in some of the more shady parts of legal practice. Fake identities, contract traps, forgery, these were a few. This was a small price of morals Belan would pay as to eventually gain enough wealth and influence to cure his sister and get his family out of the Badlands.
