> **Arcadum**: As the fourth card is turned over, it shines with ethereal light. And on the front of it, a shadowy figure. Time begins to slow, the surprised expression of the fortune teller frozen in place. As from the card a shadowy figure rises and stands beside you, Arden.<br>You stand to meet its gaze and you see pieces and shapes begin to swirl into focus. It is a man, well dressed and unkempt. He smiles with a eyeless face as he places his hand on your shoulder. And there resonates within the bright light of your soul. He holds in his hand, a shadow to pass. A deck of shadowy cards.<br>
***Arden** takes the cards<br>
**Arcadum**: As you take the cards the shadows dissipate. The cards begin to flow in front of you. They begin to appear in a rapid succession. Blinding in their repeditiy. You see the paladin, the keep, the big sky, the forge, the bear, the uprising, the fiend, the beating, the cyclone, the dance, the cricket, the juggler, the locksmith, the peacock, the rabbit prince, the Avalanche, the crow, the demon lantern, the trumpet, the survivor, the desert, the brass dwarf, the teemster, the mountain man, the the tangled briar, the sickness, the wax works, the hidden truth, the wanderer, the joke, the inquisitor, the foreign trader, the vision, the rakshasa, the idiot, the snakebite, the winged serpent, the midwife, the publican, the queen mother, the owl, the carnival, the eclipse, the mute hag, the lost, the empty throne, the theater, the unicorn, the marriage, the twin, the courtesan, the tyrant, the betrayal, and the liar. (*Harrow Cards from Pathfinder*)<br>
Each card representing a fabric of fate woven into a singular strand and that strand now ties itself upon your bow. And from your bow up through your arm it glows with an irradiated golden light. And upon this each symbol that I just described can be seen on knuckle, on hand, on arm, etched into a glorious golden tattoo. It shines with a bright light.

> As the process is done the shadowy figure appears once more. His eyeless face looks upon you with a smokey solitude. He holds up a solemn hand towards your chest. You can feel the weight of the burden that has been passed upon you. For every story and every era has a guardian of the tapestry. The time of The Seven was no different. And now it is time to pass the torch. The burden falls to you, Arden. It is you that the strands have chosen. It is you that the Toving trickster has chosen. And it is you that the Sevens' light will be seen remade.

> A symbol of the seven appears at the top of the tapestry, upon the golden tattoos upon your arm. And there, as quickly as the shadow arrived, the shadow fades. And as he does so all that you had seen before you fades as well. You are alone. Standing in an infinite void as the stars shift and shine all around you. It is at this time, in the distance, soft at first but slowly rising, bits and pieces at a time. You hear voices, begin to appear. The voices are unfocused. You do not understand them. Perhaps you do not even hear them? But then as the confusion set in the tattoos begin to glow. You hear them, whispering. All around you. They whisper in an unknown language. Understanding is not needed for them, however, for a purpose has been made anew.
>
> As the stars begin to fall away you arrive once more in your body and time begins slowly to resume. And the fourth card turns over to reveal The symbol of the Seven.
>
> ***Arden** grabs the card<br>
**Arcadum**: As you do so the fortune teller is still in shock staring as you pick up the card. And as you pick it up it fades into golden light.
