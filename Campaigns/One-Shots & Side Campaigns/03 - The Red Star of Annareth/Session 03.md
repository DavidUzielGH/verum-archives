# The Red Star of Annareth -- Session 03

Aired: 11/16/2020

## Relevant Lore

Eustace pulls out his "lore hook" scroll that he recieved before Gambler's Delight started. It is written in Eldar'Sharkai. Scroll is called "The Riddle of Waves."

Moe's new weapon, that Rixie has been working on, is revealed to be a 2-headed greataxe which is combined hand axes and in the center of which you can see a ringing bell.

While Moe speaks with his wife about the weapon the boys start messing around with the Riopek rune at one of the front desks. Eustace slams Raost's hand on the rune and it goes invisible. Envigorated with the hilarity of it, he now slams his head on the rune and it, too, vanishes. Eustace freaks out and faints. Hearing the comotion as he's headed back Moe finds a "headless" Eustace. Wokou tries to convince Moe that Raost died. Deception checks fail.

Moe scolds them a bit and uses Riopek on Raost. His vanished body parts return, but Raost's face and hand becomes etched into the desk.

While Moe is gone dealing with the boys, Ahst will shapeshift into Moe and invite Rixie to the bedroom. Upon returning Ahst tells Moe Rixie wants to see him up in the bedroom for a surprise. Moe heads up to the bedroom. (things happen :wink:)

In the mean time, some of the party searches the Shaper forge for Taladonic stuff and others explore the first floor.

Raost pulls off from the grup and walks outside. Thinking of the relation of Red Star and red Omen he pulls out the Omen orb.


Back in the building, Ahst and Eustace are reading books on Kalkateshian history and Rixie offers to make a spear for Toot.

### Omen & Raost's Special Eyes

> **Omen**: Servant, I can see you.<br>
***Raost** polishes the orb.<br>
**Omen**: I know where you are. Rife full of plunder.<br>
**Raost**: Plunder, I don't think so.<br>
**Omen**: Do you not feel the souls contained within?<br>
**Raost**: Nope. Maybe if you gave me the ability to feel them I could.<br>
**Arcadum**: Your eyes begin to shine with a red light as you fall to the ground screaming in agony. Your eyes are literally branded with Omen's strength.

Worried what Raost may have gotten up to and having already accounted for the whereabouts of the rest of the party, Moe heads outside and finds Raost.

(Perception and deception rolls are made: Moe can't see the changes to Raost's eyes)

Woops asks for clarification on what these eyes let him see. What does it mean to see souls? He can literally see into the soul of a person. This ability allows him to to see through walls identifying the party and anything with a soul.

The red crystal in the center of Annareth has *many* souls.

Heading back in side, the two rejoin the rest of the party in the library and being concerned for his friend Toot rolls a medicine check on Raost. It's high.

> **Arcadum**: The pupils around Raost are different, branded, changed. In fact, you see the symbol that they bear.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KJrFgim.jpg" alt="Omen's Name in Orian" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/KJrFgim.jpg)<br>
This specifically is Omen's name written in Orian, which is Arcadum's version of kanji.

> **Woops**: Do all of these souls look the same to me?<br>
**Arcadum**: No.

### The Party's Souls

* **Eustace** - Appears to be normal but its edges are less solidified, frayed and free flowing, as if they are leaking into the Spirit realm. Not because he is a Genasi, but because of his travel into the Dream realm as a Dream Monk.
* **Toot** - You can see the representation of Toot wreathed in celestial energy, then a great big Violet veil wrapping around it.
* **Moe** - Looks much like a normal soul, except the center has a great red eye that looks back at you.
* **Ahst** - You can see what essentially is a diamond with many reflective surfaces looking in and out. Like Ahst but made of reflective glass.
* **Wokou** - You can see that although it is simple compared to the others, within it there is a quiet silver fire.
* **Rixie** - Appears to be a white spectral maiden weeping into her hands, all around her are ashen clouds of visions and visages that have long since perished. Above that the fading form of her faith in Aladine. In the palm of her hand is a tiny little Moe.
* **Raost** - You can see a red flaming wolf with antlers, and behind it a great black chain, and a hand holding it in place, disembodied. The mirror cracks and shatters.

### Outside

Toot pulls Raost to the side and asks him about the branding on his eyes. Raost confesses to being scared of what Omen is doing to him. They move out in front of the building and eventually ask the rest of the party to come join them.

Raost finally decides to come clean with what happened in the tapestry room, when he spoke with Omen, and why he is changed.

Shattered Crowns makes a "cameo" via Arcadum's story telling. They do a few flybys in their Bandian ship, bang into some of the surrounding asteroids, and finally scrape along the bottom of the large asteroid the Red Star sits on and come to rest just poking out from the edge.

Eustace recognizes some of the voices coming from within vessle and is sarcastically convinced they're here for revenge on kill-stealing on the Parable.

Toot grabs Rixie and asks her to help with the "strange visitors."

### THE INDEX

> **Arcadum**: The Index reveals through the Red Star- which is a location of which the prism can be viewed through, specifically of this color. The Index will reveal that there is yet a hidden strength of one of the original Seven that has yet to be awakened. You must seek the dwarven king frozen in time.
>
> You are able to gain closer approximate knowledge of who the Astral Traveller is and by using the powers of the Red Star you can attempt to summon her. However, the energies of the Star and the cost of summoning the Astral Traveller costs Order to do so. That is, except, for the first summoning, which is free.

If Moe chooses to do this, she would manifest actually, physically, and he would be able to talk & interact with her and her with the environment. However, any large power like that attracts the attention of The Enemy.

Criken asks for a bit more clarification on the "Sailor Scouts" (Astral Traveller's Handmaidens). It is revealed that there aer prestige missions for the sailor scouts and they're going to start them soon, but he has to be the one that grants them that power.

### The Riddle of Waves

Eustace will show "The Riddle of Waves" to Rixie. She will read it.

> **Rixie**: What you possess is a journal of a kind, from someone from my realm. Well, that isn't accurate. More to say a realm walker. â€˜Tis the reason that we have any knowledge of your existence at all. It is she that allowed the ruins of Kaza'Huil to be built.<br>
**Eustace**: What are they?<br>
**Rixie**: They were an embassy in the ancient times, when our continents knew one another. What you possess is the last account of someone that called themselves Shapesister. A woman by the name of Nixie(sp?).<br>
A traveler, one who sailed the great ocean. It is said she and her sisters had visited every continent.<br>
**Eustace**: Is this person still alive?<br>
**Rixie**: I do not know. When I met her she was a human girl and yet ageless. Like the blood of the Eldar pumped through her. There is a place I know of where you might be able to find her. In Elda'Sharkai she made port and left behind a singular token. I supposited piece of 8. It was a simple medallion left on the dockside. It swirled with power. It would, therefore, be logical that you must do the same and seek the piece of 8 of Kalkatesh.

### The Sunstone

Attunement to the Sun Stone will be difficult because Ahst is not divine.
