# The Red Star of Annareth -- Session 01

Aired: 08/18/2020

## Relevant Lore

Moe & Bellanovan make their way up the tower and come across a room with tapestries and a curious mosaic on the floor.

> **Arcadum**: The mosaic here represents a woman's face, one that you recognize. It seems to be the visage of the Astral Traveler.<br>
On the walls there are several tapestries, and you see that there are six of them.

### Tapestries

([TAKE THESE DESCRIPTIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, TIFF HAS STATED THEY ARE NO LONGER ACCURATE](https://i.imgur.com/1SfuSpw.jpg) -- 10/31/2020)

#### Rentoss
> First you see a kindly faced woman, with white pupil less eyes, and a radiant smile. She wears a white and blue satin gown, complete with a sort of swirling cloud-like feature to it.

#### Haates
> A woman in a deep blue gown, slightly older than the other, she wears a black and yellow crown above her head, and she has twin earrings that kind of jingle with large hoops. Her face is more regal and poised.

#### Dailos
> A gown of yellow and green, complete with a red sash across her chest. She seems a little shorter than the others, and seems to have more pep and cheer to her face.

#### Verza
> Appears to be in a seated position in a comfortable chair, smiling warmly like a mother. Her gown is a deep beautiful array of crimsons and reds the hues interlapping with each other and ending in fanciful ribbons. She wears a pair of blue gloves, with black opals upon the knuckles.

#### Kasaka
> Very tall, somewhat lanky, but stands with a regal brace, definitely the most royal looking out of all of them. Her outfit is one of several interlocking scales of a viridian of colors, each color of the rainbow is represented in her rainbow sash, moving all throughout her down with deep insets of black flowers on the edges.

#### Jhasa
> A bronze maiden with kind eyes that glow with a holy fire. She wears a yellow turban, complete with a blue feather. And her dancers gown of light silk has a green hue.

### Shaper's Portal

This entire room is cracked in reality. Meaning you cannot enter this room without suffering some serious bad things, basically looks like the world is shattered in here.

> **Criken (Moe)**: Can you describe the way in which itâ€™s shattered? Specifically, is it anything we've seen before with the enemy we're fighting or is it totally different?<br>
**Arcadum**: I don't know if you yourself have seen it.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: Did it look kind of the same when the reality bending was happening in the corridor of our labyrinth.<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes, so Bellanovan recognizes it a little bit.

### Next Floor Up

> **Criken (Moe)**: Can we read the runes on the ground?<br>
**Arcadum**: You cannot read those runes, in addition, you see that the books in this library seemed to be sealed by an opaque force. Arcane energy emanates outward from [this obelisk](https://i.imgur.com/ammXijy.jpg).<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: I have seen an obelisk like that, have I?
Arcadum: Yes you have.

(There's another obelisk in the room to the left as well)

### Top of the Red Star

After proceeding up another floor the pair find themselves at the [top of the tower](https://i.imgur.com/rLfuivI.jpg).

> **Arcadum**: You now find yourself at the very top of the Red Star of Annareth. Above you a domed ceiling reveals the beauty of the Astral Sea through a red lens. As the light from the Astral Sea pours in the constellations are etched in a red light, like a constant painting shifting with the painters will. As the Star drifts through space each turning, each little vestule, makes the paint of light shift and change, like a heartbeat of the universe. You can see that there are books, tomes, tables, and all sorts of manner of information, but there is one thing that takes it all away and that is this.<br>
***Arcadum** points at a [strange device](https://i.imgur.com/nhH9Rc8.jpg)<br>
This radiates with power that you can barely even look upon it to see. Red light from the star in the center of the courtyard radiates up and within, and it pulses every few moments with red light.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: It's similar to the pulse we saw outside?<br>

---

Observing the shelves of books:
> **Arcadum**: All of the books here are of Power Words, all of them. They are all, however, sealed with a rune, a rune that says "Shaper". That is its translation, not what the word is, you do not know what the for Shaper is.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: But we can tell what the word means?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep, because it's written in Common. Well, it's written in every language at once.

---

The pair moves over to a [table with an open book](https://i.imgur.com/IQluIug.jpg):
> **Arcadum**: As you seat yourself down at this table you can see that there is a drawing of, not maps, but constellations. Bellanovan, it represents the Tapestry of Fate, and you notice something that is a little overwhelming. You can see the Tapestry of Fate, not so dissimilar to the one the Maiden provided you, except that you see that the tapestry is represented in several different colors. You can see that there is red light, there is blue light, there is green light, so on and so forth. They are drawn in different manners and different places, shifting in a constant prismatic structure, there is one light, however, that is missing. It is Violet.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: Do I know what the prism looks like?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is prismatic, not the prism. Essentially there's just different colors that seem to represent different connections.<br>
The easiest way for me to describe this given your characters limited knowledge is: Imagine the constellations in our own sky, but for some reason certain ones were given the governance of a specific color.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Do some of them have a lack of color, and that's where we're assuming Violet should be?<br>
**Arcadum**: You don't know if there's missing colors, you don't have that kind of knowledge.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: What about this book over here?<br>
***Surefour** points at the open book on the table<br>
**Arcadum**: That book is... **THE INDEX**.<br>
Write that down in capital bolded letters, please.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: Am I able to read it?<br>
**Arcadum**: As you look at the book, carefully, you can see that it is not a book as it is a list of contents. Specifically, it is literally an index. It seems to be a list of where materials can be found. However, as you begin to read through it, each time you begin to understand a word it befuddles in your mind, as if some kind of enchantment is preventing you from learning anything from the Index.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: So I just sort of forget everything I read?<br>
**Arcadum**: Not so much forget, it's more that when you read it it turns into nonsense in your head.

Moe and Bellanovan move towards the strange device Arcadum pointed out earlier and Lumina starts playing:
> **Arcadum**: You stand in one of the holiest places, for before you lies a contraption. An apparatus, a device, whose function is unclear, and daunting to attempt to know. However, attempt to know you do. As you look upon [the engine](https://i.imgur.com/nhH9Rc8.jpg), you see that it has several different points of focus, specifically there are six points of focus. Each of them appears to be a different mirrored piece of glass, focused onto a central point, where there is an orb of mirrored glass that reflects the light in all directions. However, all around it, there is a construction of metal and material that form an almost blueprinted cage, it expands outwards, the longer you look the more that you see contained within this central orb is the Astral Sea itself. You can see it, shifting, twisting. You can see the halved pieces, the spherical separations of each of the different nebulae, and within it the central point where your home of Kalkatesh can be found.
>
> All around you the ethereal energy of the red light pulses out, and with each pulse it washes over you in an overwhelming light, and then you see them. Spirits yet inhabit this engine, there are seven places where the spirits are marked, and one is awoken. The central spirit, the Astral Traveler. Six other spirits yet remain to be awoken, and in front of you there lies a place where a hand may be placed.
>
> So, do I have a volunteer?

(Moe and Bellanovan contemplate next steps, and who places their hand)

> **Arcadum**: Voices begin. It appears to be a chant coinciding with the pulse within. A chant that many have heard before when in the presence of the Seven, but it appears that the chant comes from this place.

(Moe and Bellanovan flip a coin [1d2], and Moe is selected)

> **Arcadum**: Moe places his hand on the device, and it springs to life. Power flows all around you, the Astral Sea parts, the stars sparkle, light from all directions flow around Moe. The arcane energy blows him nearly back, his hat goes flying free if not for the chin straps, he holds, gripping onto the device. Holding his place, holding his hand down upon the device. Within he sees it, the central point, a star of six points, and a center. The Astral Traveler rises up ahead of him, and around her are six handmaidens.
>
> Moe Kowbull, through the concourse of destiny you are the first player to ever have walked to the threshold, and so it falls to you, if you wish for this strength I will name you Shaper.<br>
**Moe**: I accept.<br>
**Arcadum**: So be it. There are six handmaidens, choose one of them.

(Criken eventually rolls a [1d6] and it lands on Dailos)

> **Arcadum**: The symbol of Dailos will be brought forth into being. She'll be summoned, an ephemeral spirit before you, and she will smile down. She will reach down and grasp you into an embrace, and both of you appear back in camp.
>
> However, Moe has something with him. Moe, around your neck is an amulet of Annareth, with the symbol of Dailos. You have gained the prestige class Shaper.

---

Arcadum further discussing the role of Shaper, The Astral Traveler, her Handmaidens, and how Moe is now responsible for awakening the other handmaidens:
> **Arcadum**: In the Living World, courageous maidens gather their strength to travel to the Red Star, and as the hand of the handmaiden of the Astral Traveler it will be up to you to bestow upon them her grace. There is a prestige mission that is currently being created.
