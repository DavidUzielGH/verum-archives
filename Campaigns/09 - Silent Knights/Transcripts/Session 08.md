*Note: While the YouTube video this session takes place in is labeled as episode 7, it is actually session 8 of the campaign, as the real session 5 was lost. It also bears noting that the video labeled episode 9 on YouTube is actually a reupload of episode 7. When looking for the thing that happens every 7 episodes, you should look instead to the video labeled episode 6 in the youtube playlist.*

### Sevenic Speech

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/ggiGjWnvUtI?t=1967))

> **Arcadum**: And one of the spirits stands before you, more clear than the others. And perhaps, the clearest of The Seven to have manifested so far, or one of them rather. No name is given, but her form becomes clear. 

(*They say hi*)

> **Arcadum**: She does not respond. She speaks no words. But within her hands she begins to conjure forth the essence of her spiritual energy and within it a rune begins to coalesce. It changes shape several times before it settles on a symbol. The elven symbol of luck. And with it, it begins to morph and split between good luck and bad luck. Over and over and over again until several dozen orbs float all around her. She shall then hold up her hand behind her back as if grabbing from a quiver which then forms along her back. No arrows yet lie within and she raises her bow before any that would stand before her to be judged by her arrows.

(*Several step closer*)

> **Arcadum: Let me know if you're doing it.

> ***Rainbow-After-Rain** steps forward<br>
**Arcadum**: As you step up before her, Rainbow-After-Rain, the bow will even itself before you and will pull an unseen arrow. And as she pulls it, one of the orbs will forge itself into an arrow in her hand.

(*Alignment discussion -- Rainbow-After-Rain is Neutral-Good*)

> **Arcadum**: As you denote neutral good, the orb that forms it is an arrow of misfortune. She narrows it down the bow and points it directly at you. And with it she will whisper. Just on the air, barely audible:<br>
**Spirit**: Do your best.<br>
**Arcadum**: The arrow flies from the bow and pierces your heart. As the arrow pierces your heart you are judged by this member of The Seven. 

(*Wisdom saving throw fails*)

> **Arcadum**: All around her the whispers of judgement begin to echo. Your will fades. Your facade is shattered. Within it you see your guilt refracted and reflected. You feel it echo within you. The great tree that you saw is yet still sick. As a tender of the grove and a guardian of nature's bounty you have failed in your duties. As a druid you have failed Gazenarok. You have failed the spirit tree.
>
> But do not despair. For within the eyes of this one, in the eyes of this spirit, where there is failure there is forgiveness. And where there is forgiveness there is change. Power begins to flow directly through you, Rainbow-After-Rain. The well of potential hidden within.
>
> As misfortune turns to fortune and weakness turns to strength, the spirit realm begins to crackle with the presence of the Seven. The sweetness of the smile of the woman that stands before you bears with it many terrible marks. You see her failures. Her very being itself a cursed existence. Yet when the world needed it, when darkness rose up, she stood in the light. A bridge between good and evil. A guardian of creation and The Bow of Fate. Lanis Anna Au'Luna. Daughter of Grodeus of the Darkened Moon: The Harbinger of Fate. For you have been judged... worthy.
>
> And with that, a snap of her fingers and she is gone.

(*Her eye becomes a symbol of the Seven, given power word to summon her for a boon, `Adoris`*)
