### Sevenic Speech

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/BKVNYgSNbok?t=7400))

> **Arcadum**: And you see this figure appear. A shadow in and of itself. Features difficult to make out, stands in a somber rest. It looks around you at each face. It’s eyeless, heavily hooded face stays. You can feel eyes that you cannot see stare into the very depths of you. What stands before you is one of the Seven. The heroes of the past, whose torch was passed to you. A member of the seven points out towards the gravestones and with it the dust, the corruption, and all the awful things on the stones begin to fade. The great tree. New life grows green and flowers bud and bloom all throughout the graveyard.
>
> The winds blow through the heavens, the clouds part. Their darkened curtain of despair dispelled with the high morning sun. The figure stands before you. There is a gratitude that emanates from the being. It fills you to a fullness. It will then turn its gaze and it shall point to the south west. And there, as you turn to look where it points, the world falls away and you see instead The Abbey. The spectral symbols of Oun and Wode and a feeling of terrible foreboding.
>
> It seems that your deed shall be repaid by another. At the Sevens' call you must return to Dreams Drift Abbey for whilst you have hunted this fugitive of the nightmare realms, of the dream realm, something else has occurred. Something far worse. But take heart for this time you do not walk alone.
>
> The Seven will take from its neck a seven-pointed star and it shall fall to dust around him and each of you are infused with the essence of the heroes of the past so that you might remake the future.

(*They level*)

> **Arcadum**: And with that the figure will nod and with a deep bow will fade back into the annals of history. But the star yet remains as a reminder… a reminder that no matter what evil may rise upon any horizon, that whatever darkness shall befall the land there will always be the light of those like you to spread hope to the world.
>
> And all around you, you begin to feel it. The souls, the spirits of those trapped within the stone slowly begin to awaken. Their final resting places restored. So, too, are they no longer anchored to this realm. You feel them flow all around you. They whisper to you. They whisper of gratitude, of thanks, almost as if to tell you the stories of their lives so that you too shall not forget. And then they join as one and begin to sing. Their song bears no language. It simply is. A soft whisper. A sorrowful chant. And then the sky opens and the spirits return to their rest.
