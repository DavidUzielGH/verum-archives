### Sevenic Speech

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/kp7FXCNemZw?t=11901))

As Neve reaches to grab a key near the seat White Widow once was sitting in:

> **Arcadum**: As you place your hand on the key, the world around you seems to lose detail and color.
>
> You and your comrades find yourself not within the cathedraled hall of some white widow menace, but instead on an errant field of emerald green. The sky, like a thousand sparkling sapphires, swirl in a vivid color of melted glass. You find yourself standing not by yourselves, but surrounded by shadows, shadows reflecting in the light like a broken mirror. The opaque grey smoke that comprises their forms, silhouetted against the setting sun. In the distance, you feel it: a strange ephemeral force pushing back, like a powerful wind, and a heralding trumpet.<br>
And it is in this moment that you feel it: a call, beyond the mere  mortal; the call beyond your own path; the call just on the horizon. You felt it, etched within your blood, just underneath consciousness. Each action taken, each decision made, each triumph and failure has led to this one moment. You have succeeded where others have failed, and the great torch that was once held by seven hands must now be passed along. The shadows turn, and each look upon you one, by one, by one.<br>
A wind blows through the grass, and the shadows seem to fade. Time refracts in upon itself, and you stand in the cathedral once more.
>
> The key burns ever so slightly, with the warmth of your hand, Neve.
>
>The rest of you feel the same presences in this very room as if they themselves have walked the same steps that you have. The stone around you begins to shift, growing younger, as if time is being undone. The dust moves from the walls. The broken, shattered floor begins to repair. The whole ceiling made anew. And then, all around you the sunken temple begins to rise, revealing its true nature. For this was not the lair of some criminal, but a lost temple to those that came before. A temple to the seven heroes, to the ones that came before. And now, as their power is made whole again, so too, do you stand in the presence. So, too, do you stand before the trials that they were judged.<br>
You feel that the white widow has been defeated before, that this is but just a memory repeated, over, and over again. You see the white widow, you see him refracted across several different mirrors, each a little different, yet each one the same. And as these forms begin to shift into a singular focal point, you then see them. Seven shadows. And one enemy.
>
> And such, it would seem, that the key begins to glow even brighter with its heat. The light that it emanates seems to grow, alarmingly so in your hands.
>
> And then, the cathedral begins to shake softly, you can feel yourselves being lifted up, and then you hear it softly at first, like a light breeze, perhaps even a breath. But it comes. You feel it rather than hear it at first, but then it is unmistakable. The Seven begin to call out to you in voices. The voices, you do not understand them. You are unable to make out exactly what their meaning is, but their sounds begin to fill your very souls. As one they sing. Softly, but firmly, strongly. A guiding hand that now takes its place behind you. For the torch has been passed, and the way has been lit. You have restored this temple of the Seven, and the star rises once more.<br>
So listen well, for now it falls to you. Will you brave the storm? Will you walk the path? Will you survive what is to come? Only time will tell. The stone is restored, the dust unraveled, the damage undone.
>
> The key grows bright once more and then cold in the hand of Neve.
>
> The gate behind you bursts open. The time for rest has passed. You feel the call, the trumpets, the heralds. The light of the sun pierces the smog of Bleak, for in this one moment, evil was undone. Terror was prevented. Chaos unsown. And you are triumphant. Bask, for it is  your right. It is your reward. And it is your path.
>
> And this campaign, for now, has come to a close.
