### Dusty's Meets True Death

Dusty uses Channel Divinity to read the thoughts of the man trapped in sapphire. The man fails the save on purpose.

> **Arcadum**: As you attempt to read the creature’s thoughts you are welcomed into its mind and surrounded by images, thoughts, voices, and flashes of violet light. Datto, we have some things to discuss. Okay, so, this is basically what’s going down: You are in the mind of a creature that is-- oh man I don’t even know how to describe this to someone that has no idea about it, um… essentially, you find yourself in the thoughts of a person with the backdrop of ancient and terrible thoughts kind of cascading down like a rainstorm on top of the main mind. The mind you’re standing in is a mire of corrupted desire and ambition, it’s confusing. The voices in the creature’s head appear to be both maniacal and benevolent. They appear to be both chaotic and focused. It is an overwhelming, reaming sensation of just being blasted with an ocean of thought.
>
> So, you are in a position to benefit the world greatly, and you’re also in a position to suffer what is known as Violet Death.
>
> As you begin to delve into the creature’s mind, trying to find your way back, you feel that the spell, much like a sealing of the door behind you, you can’t just end it to go back to your body, you’re going to have to find some other way back. While you stumble through the mindscape there are a couple of things that I get to reveal to you. So, this is how it’s gonna work: Dusty has so many failures before he is destroyed. You cannot escape unless you succeed on some knowledge checks. However, you are in a unique position that there are shards of knowledge and memory that you can attempt to collect which will not only give insight into what you’re currently doing, but it can give you valuable insight that could help Kalkatesh as a whole. It is up to you how much you wish to gamble. I will tell you this: you will not know how many failures Dusty needs to survive, so it will be up to you.

The group talks a bit OOC about the potentially stressful nature of it all.

> **Arcadum**: As you stumble through the mindscape the first thing that you see is a figment, a figment of a coment. Barreling through the sky. You know it as the Herald, but you feel that it watches you. But, it can't quite see you. It's eye is unfiltered, sporadic, unfocused, but you can feel the violet light pour all around you, corrupting pieces of the mind, shattering others, and in some cases, creating where there was nothing. As you step through this kind of violet haze, the Herald lingering above, you see it: Kalkatesh, lined out before you. But, instead of the verdant biomes and lush cultures there are instead these great towers of amethyst and violet light. They eminate outwards as beacons of doom and destruction. Violet light, like a false sun, pours down from the sky. Two shards of knowledge appear before you: one holds the figment of a tower, the other the figment of a mouth. Which do you choose?
>
> **Datto (Dusty)**: Tower.<br>
>
> **Arcadum**: You grasp your hand upon the memory of the tower and it shatters, flowing into your mind and all around you. You feel yourself slipping and swirling through thought, memory, until finally you stand upon the edge of astral space.

Dusty is transferred to the Starmap.

> **Dusty**: Oh, we're back here again?<br>
**Arcadum**: You float along the edge except this time you don’t believe that you are looking at the actual stars, but rather the memories and knowledge that this creature has with him. Some sections are missing indicating ignorance. Some sections have been removed indicating that something is willfully causing such a thing, but there are a few pieces that slip and shift their way towards you, but already such knowledge is burdensome. Make me a wisdom saving throw.<br>
**Datto (Dusty)**: Oh, my best stat.

(Wisdom save: `14(8)`)

> **Arcadum**: You maintain your hold and do not feel yourself slip. Now, please write down what I am about to say. Seven towers appear before your mind, just upon the edges of space.
>
> The first tower bears the curious mark of a wizard. Upon closer inspection, the wizard has a mighty- rather a wide-brimmed hat, and wears clothing of red, and he bears in his hand a staff with an ornate gem. Within the tower, you gaze closer and you see it: swirling, shattered pieces of old gods, a coast of swords, and you see the remnants of a city. A city in the shape of a tear drop.
>
> The next tower that appears before you is a tower that holds an enormous scroll that is currently closed. You see behind it a strange flower. Within it you see men and mer swirling into pieces, shattered within and without, lost in a miasmic history.
>
> The next tower is a tower that bears a crown resting upon a round table; a sword where each seat should be. Inside, you can see remnants of monarchies, a woman in a lake crying out in fear, and a sword in a stone.
>
> The next tower bears the mark of a black sun. A ring of fire right behind it and the image of a person suffering. Within the tower you see a miasma of souls in an endless cycle of suffering and death.
>
> The next tower bears the mark of a symbol of what appears to be a sphere of blue water and green land. It is however somewhat broken, shifted, with a golden sword behind and a river of mana swirling around it. Inside, you see war and strife, triumph and happiness, like an old folk tale told a hundred times.
>
> The final two. The next tower is not yet complete. It shifts, reconstructs, and is currently being built. You can see vestiges, pieces even, of the- of images of Kalkatesh? You can see that there are some faces that you think that you’ve seen before, but you’re not quite sure. You believe that you’re- that you have even seen your own party’s faces shifting in the miasma that is still building the tower.
>
> And then finally, the seventh tower. The seventh tower is naught but a platform where nothing is yet built, but instead someone waits there. As you approach the tower three shards of memory appear. They bear the following marks: a scythe, a tree, and a gate. Which do you choose?
>
>**Datto (Dusty)**: Gate.
>
> **Arcadum**: Your visage shifts. You swirl across the astral sea in a blinding speed and you find yourself staring out over an enormous gate. The knowledge buckles and twists your mind. It threatens to crush you. Wisdom saving throw.

(Wisdom save: `11(5)`)

> **Arcadum**: You feel your wisdom fail you. You reach out towards the Shattered- the- the Shattered Gate. You can see it beginning to twist and then you are jettisoned back to your choice. The gate is no longer there. There yet remains a scythe and a tree.
>
> **Datto (Dusty)**: Tree.
>
>**Arcadum**: As you choose the tree, you shift widely back to where nebulas and feelings of size mean nothing and you see it in all of its swirling glory: a great tree of Life. The knowledge wanes, it weighs heavily upon you, threatening to shatter you completely. Wisdom saving throw.

(Wisdom save: `18(12)`)

> **Arcadum**: You maintain your sanity just long enough to pick up on a few pieces of information. You see it: the point in the branch- the point in the branch where Kalkatesh rests. You see yourself, Tirsis, Ulm, Elwood, Claw, yourself, Gorrul. It threatens to rip your mind- tear it to pieces. Two shards of memory appear: the scythe, which now has a figure behind it, and a door.
>
>**Datto (Dusty)**: Door.
>
> **Arcadum**: Dusty reaches out towards the door but hesitates. It is not temptation, but rather a heightened sense of things. You feel that if you take the door now no one may never have the chance to know who wields the scythe. I will ask you only one more time: What is your choice?
>
>**Datto (Dusty)**: Alright, scythe, fine!
>
>**Arcadum**: As you wish. Dusty falls through the tree to the edge of all things, and there he sees it: a ring. A massive ring! The ring appears to have a hole in the center that leads to nothing and you see it: it is one of the covenants. The covenants that bind the world and there, looking out over all creation, you see a figure with a scythe. Your mind wills you forward and you stand before something, something nearly incalculable, unknowable. Your mind begins to twist, knowledge taking its toll. Make me one more wisdom saving throw.

Dusty is moved into a different part of space, black with pinpoints of white stars, but still on the Starmap.

(Wisdom save: `19(13)`)

> **Arcadum**: Dusty almost shatters. Almost breaks. Almost fails. Almost. He stands shaking, his knees weak, and the figure turns to face him.

(Arcadum plays "To Zanarkand")

> **Arcadum**: The creature that turns to face you wields a great scythe, not as a weapon, but as something to lean on. Its robes are black and smoke, its face unseeable, its hand shadow and sacred softness. Around its neck it wears a chain that ends in an hourglass that is always out.

> **Death**: (*Laughs*) Apologies for my laughter. Old men are not usually so eager to meet me.

True Death’s token is revealed.<br>
[<img src="" alt="True Death's Handout" height="250px" />]()

> **Dusty**: Yeah well, up until a couple of weeks ago I was probably already knocking on your door.<br>
**Death**: (*Laughs*) And now here you stand at my door. There is an irony, I think, in that. Hm. Hm… Bemusement, however, is outside of our reach, for the things we must speak of are far more solemn than that. I know how you speak to me. I know the danger you have taken to be here and I know the peril that you will face when you return. I did not know whom would be the next to speak to me, but I knew what the cost would be should they do so.
>
> Your eyes tell me that you know who I am, but rudeness is not my way. Those that live call me Death. A fitting name, I suppose, but truth be told I do not have one. I have not had the privilege. That privilege is for your kind. To exist. And something threatens that existence, something that is not me. I am bound by the covenants lest I would see this Herald destroyed, but I cannot. The cost of your freedom- your freedom from fate and tyranny, your freedom to live was the cost of my protection. The Great Tree grows and its branches are so weighted. What I would do to trim it again, but alas my eyes look outward for it approaches and I must be ready to guide those that will carry the torch left behind. But, enough philosophy from an old man, I suppose, but that’s not accurate either. I know how you came to be here and I shall see that you return to your home, but I know that your mind brims with questions. There are many things I would not doubt you wish to speak to me of, but understand the burden of knowledge. Ask only what is necessary, and when you are satisfied, I shall return you to your comrades.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, here’s how this works. You may ask Lord Death whatever questions you wish. Unlike asking through a violet filter these cannot cause consequences, however, Lord Death can always choose not to answer. Keep in mind that every answer you are given runs the risk of your mind shattering from its weight. Lord Death will not allow you to ask a question if he believes the answer will shatter you completely. So, this is about as risk free as this will ever be, so I suggest you don’t waste it, and take your time deciding what questions to ask.<br>
**Datto (Dusty)**: Is there a limit to how many?<br>
**Arcadum**: As much as your mind can handle, big guy. Tiffany, you may provide advice for only one question.<br>
**Datto (Dusty)**: Alright, so not a lot. Ho, man.

> **Dusty**: Alright, when you were talking, you said “for it approaches”, and you “must be ready to guide those who will carry the torch left behind it”. What is- what is approaching?<br>
**Death**: The Herald. And behind it something far worse.

> **Arcadum**: That doesn’t count as a mind shatter because you already kinda knew it.

> **Dusty**: Um, the uh, man trapped in the sapphire. What- what was he lookin’ for?<br>
**Death**: A way out, much like yourself, but not a way out of his prison, a way out of his existence. Hm. Perhaps that is too philosophical. The creature sought to cause more devastation, corruption, and dissonance on behalf of its master.<br>
**Dusty**: Is its master the Herald?<br>
**Death**: Yes.<br>
**Dusty**: Who is that man?<br>
**Death**: What he is now is the servant of the Violet. But, he was once- he was once something great. He was- he was a wizard. He led the Mage’s Guild through the Great Reckoning. He stood with the Seven and when the era shifted and he was lost, he was in fact stolen and infected. His name is Los [pronounced "loss"].

(Wisdom save: `14(8)`)

> **Arcadum**: Your mind begins to shift, swirl, and twist. You fall to a knee. Death reaches out to help you up, but stops and pulls back its hand. Even with a close proximity you could feel your lifeforce being slowly snuffed out. Death, therefore, keeps its distance and watches as it always has as life grows and life withers and Death can never touch. You will struggle to your feet. Your body is strong, your mind is weakened, but Death allows you to ask a question.<br>
**Dusty**: The seven stones, why are they- why are they so important?<br>
**Death**: The stones represent aspects of divinity, concentrated forms of those things that govern all things. They are the results of my covenants. Without them the Shattered Gate will never be repaired.<br>

(Wisdom save: `23(17)`)

> **Arcadum**: You maintain your sanity and may ask another question.

> **Dusty**: Oh, man. I'm really- really wracking my brain. The uh, the Herald- is uh, is there a way to stop it?<br>
**Death**: Yes. You and those like you- The Herald. The Violet. It is not over yet. The path of The Seven must be walked and that which was made must be broken again.<br>

(Wisdom save: `21(15)`)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, you get another one.

> **Dusty**: I’m going to guess maybe we need all of those stones to walk the path of The Seven. Are the seven stones required to walk the path of The Seven?<br>
**Death**: Seven stones are required, but there are more than seven stones.<br>
**Dusty**: There's more. There's more than seven? Ah, jeez.

(Wisdom save: `18(12)`)

> **Arcadum**: Your mind is strong.

> **Dusty**: You're really wracking my brain on that one. Oh, boy.<br>
(*More old-man muttering*)<br>
How do we- how do we use the seven stones?

> **Arcadum**: Clarification on that: in what way do you mean “use”?

> **Dusty**: When we collect the seven stones, what do we do with them?<br>
**Death**: The stones are aspects of divinity. They can be used to ascend. They can be used to specific effect, to control the rain, sky, fire, death, life, it depends on the stone, and they can be used to repair the Shattered Gate.<br>
**Dusty**: You know, I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

(Wisdom save: `24(18)`)

> **Arcadum**: Your mind is strong.

> **Dusty**: Why do we need to repair the Shattered Gate?<br>
**Death**: If the Gate is repaired, then all of creation can stand against the Herald.<br>
**Dusty**: I figured it was Herald related, or at least Herald-adjacent.

(Wisdom save: `26(20)`)

> **Arcadum**: There it is. Alright, Datto, we have something else to discuss now. Alright, Professor Dusty now no longer has a life span. You have accumulated a sufficient amount of knowledge and have survived it that you are now granted the title of Translator.
>
> I need to make several adjustments now. Alright, listen up. This is what a translator means. First of all, translators no longer are bound by mortal life. That doesn’t mean you can’t be killed that just means you no longer have a life span, so there’s that. You will not die of old age. So, the current age that you are at is the age that you will remain. Let’s see… The next thing is that you are granted resistance to violet corruption. Which means that you may hold knowledge as a repository of the various secrets of the world. You will be able to do this with less risk of violet corruption. To be clear that doesn’t mean that you are immune that just simply means that you can ask- if questions were tiered in the level of corruption they would hold, you can handle minor and lesser ones without any risk, medium ones with little risk, so on and so forth. As you have ascended to the level of the translator, that means there are three pieces of information I give you for free.

[Arcadum tells Datto these three pieces of information in private]

> **Arcadum**: Alright, now that you have achieved the uh… status of a Translator you may continue to ask questions if you wish.

> **Dusty**: Where can we find more stones?<br>
**Arcadum**: Stones are found in, uh, leylinic crossings of the leylines and in places of power. They can also be found in the possession of powerful entities that have collected them over the years.<br>
**Dusty**: How do we keep Los in prison, in that sapphire?<br>
**Arcadum**: You must finish the ritual that was began.<br>
**Dusty**: Do you know what that ritual was?<br>
**Death**: The ritual was a binding of the soul. And I believe there should be the instructions on how to finish and on how to end it within that library.<br>
**Dusty**: Who put Los in that prison?<br>

> **Arcadum**: [To self] Now that I have to double check, because I think I… I might’ve crossed that story off. [Goes silent for a bit]

> **Death**: Two servants. Two servants of the Violet trapped and infected him, for long had they watched within his mind, long had they hunted him. His battle against the Violet alongside The Seven took a great toll. It took his arm, burned his torso, and he carried with him a great burden of pain. But the worst were the stains on his soul. Los had a saying which I always found to be… (*laughs*) amusing in its simplicity. He used to say that, "Logic without emotion is a dead thing and emotion without logic is a dangerous thing. One must always find the balance." It is a cruel irony that they are the same things that bound him in the end; the corrupted aspects of logic and emotion. They yet still linger within the Vault of Ages.<br>
**Dusty**: Is there a way to purify, to uncorrupt him, specifically?<br>
**Death**: Once corrupted one cannot come back. As far as my power knows.<br>
**Dusty**: I'll take your word for that one. So I guess the only way to stop ‘em would be to keep ‘em- keep ‘em sealed up, or uh- or… get rid of ‘em, to put it lightly.<br>
**Death**: It would seem so.

(Wisdom save: `14(8)`)

> **Arcadum**: Your newfound title of the Translator does not come without its own burdens. This time, your mind finally gives way under the strain of such knowledge. You fall to a knee and Death moves towards you standing just on the edge of where he is safely to be. And he says:
>
> **Death**: Your mind is strong, but a life- but your time with me has come to its end. Thank you for the conversation. It has been some time, but you have proven yourself worthy of a title, worthy of your place in the world. Do not waste it for the time is nearly upon us all. We will meet again.<br>
**Dusty**: Yeah well, I’ll look forward to it.<br>
**Death**: Hm! Not many do.

> **Arcadum**: Death will raise his scythe and will slice a tear through the void, will lift you up, and throw you through.<br>
And you return, merely seconds have passed.
