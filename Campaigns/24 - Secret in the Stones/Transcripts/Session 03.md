### Tyrsis Reborn

After Tyrsis loses a clash against the white dragon, Dialos the Ryme, she wakes up within the Dream. She hears a voice calling her, asking for her to enter a sealed library. Within, she finds a great dragon named Ezerikell Korkaza:

> **Tyrsis**: You’re very pretty.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Ah, so good it is to be released from such an errant prison. A prison improperly placed, I might add. A cruel irony I suppose, of Cassius and his humans. But where are my manners? Greetings, mortal. I am Ezerikell Korkaza. I am a caretaker of the Dragonstorm. Hand of Lord Empereptor(sp?), and speaker for the Dreaming Dragons.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Um, I- pleased to meet you, Ezerikell, I’m Tyrsis. My ancestors were draconic. I come from a long line of draconic sorcerers. I’m very pleased to meet you, you’re very pretty.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Your flattery is properly placed, but I sense your bloodline. Strong, flame, light. The gold burns bright within you, mortal. But I wonder, will it burn bright enough, when the time comes?<br>
**Tyrsis**: I feel I’ve already failed. It wasn’t bright enough, that’s why I’m here.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: You are here because you suffered. You suffered as only one of your kind can. Blood tested to the limit, has within it a most forgiving aspect. For that which was broken can be repaired, and something that is repaired is stronger than before.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Well, I’m ready to be repaired, so that I can be strong for my friends.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Ready to be repaired you say? Well, interesting. So be it. I shall see to your repair myself, however, there is something you must do for me. Nothing in this world or the world beyond is free.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I thought opening the door was what you needed?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Ah, to take you home, but not to fix you.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Okay, what is the price?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: The price of fixing you?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Yes<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: It’s a very simple item, truly. You’ll hardly even miss it. What I need from you, is this. A single strand of your hair.<br>
**Tyrsis**: My hair, may I ask what will be done with it?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: You may ask.<br>
**Tyrsis**: But you will not answer?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Well you haven’t asked me yet.<br>
**Tyrsis**: What will be done with my strand of hair?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: It shall be placed in its proper place, amongst the threads of our kind.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I would give it freely.<br>
***Tyrsis** plucks out hair and gives it to him.

> **Arcadum**: The strange dragon will take the hair, and wrap it around his finger, and then close it. And the strand disappears.

> **Ezerikell Korkaza**: Right, it is time to get you-<br>
**Arcadum**: He will look up, as if seeing something that you can’t. He will close the door and his wing will cover you.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Silence.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Okay.

> **Arcadum**: Footsteps echo, as two humanoids walk by the nearby windows. One of them appears to be a yuan-ti, a snake person, wearing what appears to be a lab coat. She is currently conversing with a fanciful looking orc woman with a beaming smile, and they walk by.

(These are player characters from the Silent Knights campaign)

> **Ezerikell Korkaza**: That was close.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Who were they, they looked nice. She had a nice smile.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: They are of no consequence. Wardens. Wardens of a prison.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Why are you in prison?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: I was imprisoned for doing the right thing.<br>
**Tyrsis**: What was the right thing, that you did?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Shattered the Dream of the Dragons.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Why? How was that the right thing?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: That is a long story, but very well. Once, there were no dragons on Kalkatesh, merely the Linnorms. Our flightless, degenerate comparisons. And we were from the land of Dragonstar. Glorious, where chromatic, metallic, and primal battled like raging storms. The very nature of our world was our conflict and debate. It was a beautiful thing to see.
>
> Alas, interruptions. Our strongest ventured to a new world where they might forge their own path, so they say. And thus, these traitorous dragons, they came to this place and found it easy. They began to assimilate; they took over everything and then eventually they warred with the other powerful races and eventually summoning forth humanity. These are the dragons that you know of. But you are all of you deceived. For while some of these traitors are of our kind, their blood is mixed. They are not unlike mongrels, twisted and self-serving.
>
> And so it is, that I tried to reason with them. I tried to tell them what the cost of their freedom was and only one listened to me. And that was Runethares. I had thought that the dragon father would be more understanding. Agreeing with me as he did, he did nothing to stop what happened next. Dragonstar was sealed from interaction with Kalkatesh. Verum closed its doors to us and thus the storm was split in twain, weakened on both sides and fading. And I could do nothing, but watch from my cramped tower.<br>
**Tyrsis**: They imprisoned you for that?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: T’was not Runethares that imprisoned me, it was The Seven.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I see…why, why did The Seven?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Do you wish to know?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Yes.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Very well. Then I shall tell you why, The Seven imprisoned me.

(The stream is muted for a few minutes, and Tyrsis is given information that the stream wasn’t allowed to hear)

> **Ezerikell Korkaza**: The Seven sealed me, for they thought I was too dangerous. That I had sought to learn too much. For you see, there are some things in this world that are dangerous to know. There are some things in all worlds that are dangerous to know. And in my seeking, within my search to find a way to heal the Dragonstorm, the souls of my people, I discovered something else entirely. I discovered the secret of refaction.<br>
**Tyrsis**: What the hell is refraction? Or do I not even want to know? Is it too dangerous for me? I don’t want to be imprisoned; I just want to go to my friends.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Oh, do you not wish to know?<br>
**Tyrsis**: I mean, I can’t not know. If there’s something to know I want to know it, but will it get me imprisoned too, or can we fly away together?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Oh we can leave, for you see The Seven have long since faded from this world. They are not but shadows. There are some that claim to be them, but they are false. There are some that "hold the torch" so to speak, but they are no Seven.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Oh, um- and uh- those that hold the torch for the Seven, I suppose that you don't like them very much?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: It is not that I do not like them, it is that they are simply following the same pied piper's song that has been followed, apparently, several times before. It is an action, a practice in insanity, to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. So as such, it is not that I do not like them. I pity them. And I take them and attempt to instruct them of the truth.
>
> **Tyrsis**: Well, then tell me the truth of refraction, why is it so dangerous?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Let me ask you this, a metaphor, perhaps. If you poison a well, who dies?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Anyone that drinks from the well.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Ah, but the water does not die.<br>
**Tyrsis**: No.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: The earth does not die.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Um, it might sink into some of the other ground water and poison some of the plants and the creatures, if they partake of it.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: But the water stays the same. Truly it does, it does not cease to be water. But its function changes, yes? Do you understand the metaphor?<br>
**Tyrsis**: I…<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: What once gave life, now gives death. And yet it is the same. And that is the secret that I discovered. For what I have learned, was that a mortal’s perspective is that the water is different, when the reality of it is that it is the same. And that is how I discovered what a soul truly is.<br>
**Tyrsis**: What is it?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: It is a reflection, infinite in its faculties. Like the facets of a gem, ever changing, and solid. I was so close to learning the truth, so close I was. Before I was imprisoned, but now, I will return to the Twilight Station and I shall finish my research.<br>
**Tyrsis**: What do you seek to do with the knowledge? What’s the ultimate goal? Just knowing?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: To save the Dragonstorm of course. The Dragonstorm fades, it is split in twain and my people suffer and die. No new births are given, we are disjointed from the lifestream due to the actions of the traitors. I have beseeched the Guardian of the Life Stream, of the Shattered Gate, and received no answer. So therefore, I shall go to that dangerous place, and I shall seek my answers there.<br>
**Tyrsis**: It’s a worthy endeavor and I wish you well on it.
>
> **Ezerikell Korkaza**: And yet we come to the problem of you. You wish to be fixed, and yet here you are. Not quite dead, yet not quite alive.<br>
**Tyrsis**: But, by your reckoning my soul has gone unchanged. I’m still the same.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Yes, but you’re poisoned. For the reality is, the water that is poisoned does both. It gives life, and death, and it does not change. Therefore, we must take that which is poisoned, that which is broken, that which is not whole. And we shall make it whole again. Place your hand upon my wing child, and I shall shatter your soul.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Um, that sounds like not being whole again. That sounds like breaking even further.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: And yet, do you have a choice?<br>

(Tyrsis makes an insight check, natural `20`)

> **Arcadum**: This creature is not lying to you.

> **Tyrsis**: With a shattered soul, will I know who I am? Will I be me? Why shatter it?<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: I had thought the same thing when I first heard of it. And yet the more I looked the more I realized. What is it that you think that you are, exactly? You think that you are what, a woman, yes? You think you are person? That you have thoughts and feelings?<br>
My dear girl, you are essences, wrapped and twisted into a singular concoction of the life stream. You are fear. You are sadness. You are happiness. You are courage and fear. You are all of these things. As the Nephilim did say, you are but a result of the many into the whole. To be shattered is to be reduced to your most basic pieces and then, with a will to be remade. The most powerful of souls are able to produce more than they had before through the act of refraction. So, dear mortal, would you like to know?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Alright, Ezerikell, shatter me and rebuild me better.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Oh dear girl, I’m not the one that fixes you.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, Danielle, we get to remake Tyrsis made out of her basic parts. First, we will start. Alright, first things first, let’s begin. Would you like a masculine soul or a feminine soul?<br>
**Traveldanielle (Tyrsis)**: Feminine soul.<br>
**Arcadum**: A human soul is malleable and strong, but in the dream realm there are other ingredients that were not there upon your birth. Would you like to gamble or maintain your current race?<br>
**Traveldanielle (Tyrsis)**: I think I wanna maintain.<br>
**Arcadum**: Your commitment to the draconic bloodline flows through your destiny, but there are others to choose from that only the dream can reveal. There are the astral dragons, there is also the umbral dragons, or you may remain a gold.<br>
**Traveldanielle (Tyrsis)**: Umm, let’s try astral.<br>
**Arcadum**: Courage, fear, sadness, happiness, these are the pieces that make Tyrsis. However, which of these emotions do you hold above the rest. Any emotion.<br>
**Traveldanielle (Tyrsis)**: Alright, courage.<br>
**Arcadum**: Okay, and then finally, as you have chosen the astral, the fire that burns within you takes on a different gait. It becomes prismatic, white, it fades in and out of astral strength. But now I wonder, out of these choices, which do you think causes the least harm?
>
> To take what you need; to give what is not wanted; to love what you hate; to hate what you love?<br>
**Traveldanielle (Tyrsis)**: I think to love what you hate does the least harm, there’s always more room for love.<br>
**Arcadum**: Very well, Tyrsis is remade, her soul reforged. No longer is she trapped between the two realms of the waking and the dead. You are otherwise fine with the following changes. You might need a slight colorswap as your hair takes on a white streak. All of your fire damage that you deal from now on deals astral fire damage instead. And the dragon within that pulses from within is not gold, but rather surges with the power of the astral dragon. A soft white light, like starlight, weaving through the void and vacuum of the astral sea.

> **Ezerikell Korkaza**: It seems that you found your way back, how delightful.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I feel…different. I feel strong. I know things. Thank you.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: You are welcome, it is time however for you to wake, your friends are worried and I must now return to the storm.<br>
**Tyrsis**: If you have need of me to help restore the dragonstorm, my ancestors, please call upon me.<br>
**Ezerikell Korkaza**: Very well. Time to wake up.
