# Secret in the Stones -- Session 11

Aired: 10/19/2020

## Relevant Lore

> **Arcadum**: You hear the song of creation.

(a.k.a. The Song of the Seven)<br>
(a.k.a. "`Lumina`")


> **Arcadum**: The song of creation flows all around you. As truth begins to surge forward, the songs, wishes, wants, and voices of all those that came before sound as one. Each color a different voice, each note a different hue, and all of them, swirling within the center of the prism stone, and as such the colors rise, and you fall within. All around you, you begin to see shapes of the past, reflections of yet what may come, and truth in all things.
>
> The Gravetender stands with you, and now his mark within the color’s glows brightly, and all around are different shades that are just like him, yet different from the same. And each piece a different guardian, each one a different mark upon the great wheel, each one a warning, each one a sign.
>
> As you stand within this, the great wheel is revealed. Sectioned by colors, each one a step-in time, each one a mark to turn, each one a piece of a whole. Until the very end as the last color upon to turn the wheel is Violet and missing. For it bleeds into the realm around; the color corrupts and turns with a malignant will. It contorts, and twists, and takes, and each time the wheel cannot complete its turn with the threat of its shattering. And each time the wheel is pulled back from thousands of hands that grip as one, and pull with the strength of life, and as the wheel is reset, so too is there peace. For a time.
>
>Five times before has this occurred. Upon the sixth, the cusp of your journey, each life, much the same, though different in its way. All are connected, until what stands before you, and freedom, a fleeting wish that is impossible. Impossible in its trueness, for the tapestry can offer no freedom while it is twisted by the cycle of suffering, and while there are those that do despair, and those that have given up their hope, there within the stone you see the seven pieces of the wheel converge into the center, the spoke, the seven pointed star shines bright the light of hope, which is all of the colors in their proper order. The infinite light of the prism, the infinite light of potential, power, and desire.
>
> And then, as you gaze upon it, the song softly enters your heart. It begins to rise, and within it you feel your own voice join the chorus. It echoes within your very soul, refracting, twisting, and reflecting all around you. Until it slowly, but surely, soft at first, begins to get louder, and louder, and louder, until finally it rises with a crescendo. You look above you, the light contorts, and it opens, and there you see the truth, and the secret within the stone. That this world has been repeated, this world has been predicted, and the only way, the only way that it can be saved is to break the cycle, to prove the Violet wrong.
>
> And so, this purpose rises anew, and although the Seven have faded their iteration, so too do the Torchbearers return to where they belong, and each of the prisms guardians slowly awaken. For each time before, although there has been failure, the light of hope has never gone out, and like the candle before the hurricane's wind, it stands true, and light guides the darkness, shattering all doubt, and despair. And so, as the prism is opened, the iteration is determined, and each one of you is chosen, so too do those that reflect with your soul, and refract across the entirety of the continent rise up as once. You turn within a single swell, your weapons drawn from their sheathes, the magic summoned from within. Power challenged, power gained, and purpose is finally renewed, and thus the prism begins to close. And the guardian looks to you.

> **One of Two**: And so it is… Hopebearers, the secret is revealed. My brethren must be awakened, I sense that the cross may yet be completed, I can sense that my brother has been awakened. But there are yet other pieces of the prism that remain in sleep. And now for your purpose, translator.

It will turn towards Taffy, whose face pales slightly, but nods.

> **One of Two**: A translator's purpose is to hold this knowledge, for such knowledge is destructive, and all knowledge of the Prism bares each color, including the Traitor’s. Are you ready, Translator?

Taffy will nod.

> **One of Two**: I will leave it to your companions to choose which color shall we seek.

---

Out of character stuff, choosing the next campaign.

---

> **Arcadum**: You have uncovered one of the pieces of the Blue Cross, the other half has been found by another group.
>
> The Indigo Scar is being handled by another group, so that’s covered.
>
> One piece out of the Green Triangle has been discovered, so there are two of them that still need to be found.
>
> None of the Yellow Square has been dealt with.
>
> The Orange Star has only just begun to be dealt with.
>
> The Red Star has had… One piece of it discovered.
>
> And those are your options for now, because the Seven Pointed Star is everything, so.

Group then contemplates which color to choose, eventually settling on Yellow Square -- Quadrinox

### Two campaign choices for the yellow Square:

> **Arcadum**: You can attempt to serve the Amber Lord, which will give you access to protections for Kalkatesh against the Violet.

OR

> Enter the Quadrinox, and attempt to salvage the power of the past iterations. This will deal with the Obituary Towers.<br>
> Five iterations, five towers.

---

> **Arcadum**: Yellow squares will appear in [Taffy's] eyes as she begins to reveal where the Quadrinox can be found. she begins to write them on parchment, hand moving while eyes see elsewhere. As she continues to write, arcane instructions appear on the parchment, continue to write, continue to write, continue to write, the color of yellow begins to contort and violet takes its place, and it begins to be scribbles on the parchment,  the guardian moves to stop Taffy from writing. holds it off of the paper, and you see violet cracks in Taffy's skin.

> **Taffy**: I didn't think it would hurt so much.<br>
**One of Two**: You have fulfilled your purpose Translator, I am afraid your time is limited.<br>
**Taffy**: I am happy to have served. What happens next, Guardian?<br>
**One of Two**: I'm afraid that what happens next is that you are forgotten.<br>
*Group*: No, we won’t forget.<br>
*Ulm*: You guys will, you won’t see her ever again, you won’t know she’s ever been here.<br>
**Group**: What, why, are you erasing our memories?<br>
**One of Two**: That is the nature of the enemy you face, the power of the Violet, the truth, the final one. The Violet destroys not only life, but its presence, its ripple. It silences its light. The song loses its notes. When one dies to the Violet they are forgotten, erased from the tapestry. There are some that can remember, yes. those with sight.<br>
***One of Two** gestures at Ulm.<br>
**Ulm**:  I’ll remember you Taffy.<br>

Ulm walks up to Taffy and hugs her.

> **One of Two**: This is the cost, this is the Translator’s burden.<br>
**Elwood**: is Dusty going to have the same thing where we don’t remember Dusty?<br>

The creature will turn to look at Dusty and say:

> **One of Two**: A Translator's life is determined by the strength of their will, but it is their purpose to contain this corruption. Yes, eventually, the purpose of knowledge will be served.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I hate it.<br>
**One of Two**: Good. Use that hatred, use the love of your comrades, the hatred of the Enemy. It matters not to me, for without its conviction you will fail. You must understand that the Enemy you face cares nothing for anything, not even itself. It is an action, a state. You cannot expect that water does not flow, so the Violet destroys. It is a source of power that can be wielded by some, but is not to be trusted. It is forged of a shattered covenant, it is the traitorous color, unless we stop it, it will consume us all.
>
> In either case, Taffy's purpose as a translator has been spent. You now have your path, Torchbearers. I shall tend to her, perhaps I may yet buy her some time.

The Gravetender will tend to Taffy, revealing his purpose. And then you will see that as he tends to her, he slowly begins to weave a crystalline face that looks just like hers, and looks just like the ones here. (Arcadum points to the sphere in the center of the room)

> **Tyrsis**: Are these all Translators, forgotten?<br>
One of Two: Yes. I keep what memories of them I can, alive. In some way.<br>
**Elwood**: If the Violet’s defeated and all, do they come back?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Or at least memory of them, does that come back?<br>
**One of Two**: there is hope that such a thing happens, but it has never been defeated, so.<br>
**Tyrsis**: It's never met us, it better prepare itself<br>
**One of Two**: Your will is strong, sorceress. Good.<br>
**Taffy**: Guardian?<br>
**One of Two**: Yes?<br>
**Taffy**: Will I have time to say goodbye?<br>
**One of Two**: I have given you what time that I can<br>
**Taffy** will hug Ulm as the violet cracks on her cheeks begin to widen.<br>
**Taffy**: I'm sorry I couldn't tell you, it's against the rules.<br>
Ulm: It's okay, I understand.<br>
**Taffy**: You were always the kindest to me. I had not really met anyone of my kinds. You gave me kinship for a while, and I am very grateful.<br>
*Ulm*: I'll miss you Taffy.<br>
***Taffy** will hold Ulm.<br>
**Hatter Mad**: Surely something can be done, it doesn't have to be like this, does it?<br>
**One of Two**: I am afraid so. I will keep what I can of her alive, but until the enemy is defeated, this is the fate of every Translator. This is the cost of knowledge.<br>
**Hatter Mad**: This is so horrible, she's a kind lass. Surely there’s... Could I help her?<br>
**One of Two**: NO! Never must you risk anything of that nature.<br>
**Hatter Mad**: But why?<br>
**One of Two**: You. You are one of the few pieces of this board of yet we have an advantage. You do not know your own value, Hatter Mad. But you possess true freedom. You are the walker between spaces, only one other being has ever had that strength. And she yet guards the apex of the Red Star. You even bear the likeness of her color in your hair.<br>
***Hatter Mad** will grab her hair and kind of look at it for the first time.<br>
**One of Two**: Translator.<br>

They look at eachother

> **One of Two**: It is time.<br>
***Taffy** will nod, and will let go of Ulm.

She will walk up toward the crystal, and will turn as the Violet begins to eek across her skin, across her arms. She will take off her hat, and will put it on the ground.

The Gravetender will stand beside her, and finish weaving the crystal mask, and he will place it into the miasmic crystal.

> **One of Two**: I will keep your memories here. I hope it is enough.<br>
***Taffy** will smile and say "Thank you all. I was happy to be of service."<br>
**Group**: Thank you, we won't let you down. We’ll make you proud. We’ll remember you, Taffy.

Ulm will pick up her hat and hold it and hug it.

Where once there was once Taffy, there now is Dust. The Violet takes its place.

The shining light of the eye of the Seven will flash against each of you. As one small recompense for having a Seven in your party, and having a seventh eye, is that you are resistant to the Violet's corruption. You do not forget who Taffy is, but you know that she is forgotten. Perhaps that is worse.

> **Gorrul**: I know that this is what we've been... This has been our goal for the past however long... And we know how difficult the violet is, but to actually see it take something away from us right in front of us its....<br>
**Dusty**: Brutal, yeah.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Well we better get on our way to defeating it, cause if you think that I’ll let that happen to Professor Dusty, I’m going to burn the world down around us, so we might as well get going.<br>
**Gorrul**: I assume he’s going to die of old any time now, so I’d rather just have that happen than the Violet take him.<br>
**Dusty**: Thank you, I guess, but we’ll talk about those things…<br>

(Group banter…)

> **Tyrsis**: How do we get to this yellow quadra… cube thing?<br>
**Arcadum**: And on the parchment is Taffy’s gift, the fruit of the labor of her sacrifice. They are instructions for teleportation, that if anyone capable of doing so could read and take one there. Or perhaps the use of a powerful mage, a teleportation circle, or a vessel of some kind.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Or perhaps a hat?<br>
**Arcadum**: Or a hat.<br>

(The Hatter Mad is losing it, all these revelations crashing into her.)

> **Hatter Mad**: I don’t know what the fuck is going on, or what I am, or anything.. ALright, yeah.

Hatter Mad will study the parchment like one would study a grocery list, then she’ll feel it out.

> **Hatter Mad**: Alright, yeah, I think I got it.<br>
**Hatter Mad**: Little goblin?<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah?<br>
**Hatter Mad**: Could I see the hat?
***Hatter Mad** takes the hat, and looks at it with loving eyes, then will tap the top of it, and it will correct itself in size, and changes its style just a little bit, and she will place it on Ulms head.
**Hatter Mad**: A rightful place, don’t you think?<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah, I don’t ever want to lose it.

(Claw tries to be a DICK and pretends to forget Taffy.)

> ***Mad Hatter** opens the portal...

(And the season comes to an end.)

---

(Gorrul asks about Babylon clock from Raquel.)

> **One of Two**: That is a timekeeper’s piece. It keeps time, in the literal sense. It is said that the goddess of Time can store moments within these objects, it is even said that the bearer of such a piece can quicken and slow time for themselves.

#### Raquel's Timepiece/Clock

How the watch works:
> You can quicken time for yourself, meaning you can move 9 months ahead, for yourself. So that you can have a baby and not interfere with the campaign.
