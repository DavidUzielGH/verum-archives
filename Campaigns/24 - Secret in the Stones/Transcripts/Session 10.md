# Secret in the Stones -- Session 10

## Relevant Lore

After Claw opens a door in the Library, a bright light flashes and at the beginning of this session they are transported... somewhere.

### Realm of The Blue Cross

After exploring the compound they found themselves in front of, the party discovers a strange room with a sphere of ethereal, swirling, lights:

> **Dusty**: What the hell am I looking at?<br>

> **Arcadum**: Alright smart people, Religion and Arcana time.<br>
**Rhabby (Claw)**: Which one of them? One or the other?<br>
**Arcadum**: Both.<br>
**Sivelle (Ulm)**: Do you have to be one of the smart ones to make this roll?<br>
**Arcadum**: No no no, everyone can make them.

(Result: `22` Arcana, `23` Religion)

> **Arcadum**: You know that whatever that is, it is high level shit. Specifically what you are looking at is spirits and souls and their essence warped and swirling into a sphere in which their faces, their memories, their wants. their dreams yet still linger on.<br>
**Rhabby (Claw)**: Kinda like Hercules?<br>
**Arcadum**: Something like that but not quite. The faces stare out from the sphere and scream with no voice as the horrid realization of what they are seems to be constantly crashing into them.

> **Ulm**: Why are we in here guys?<br>
**Dusty**: We don't have any way out of here.<br>
**Claw**: I thought the puzzle solving was more fun.<br>
**Ulm**: This place seems creepy, it's unnatural.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Is there anyway we can help them pass on?<br>
**Claw**: Maybe this room has a (Blue) Cross to?<br>
***Claw** searches a foot locker.<br>
**Arcadum**: He finds nothing but candles of different shapes, sizes, and colors. There is some meaning and purpose to them but you can not find out what.<br>

> ***Tyrsis** searches a chest on the other side of the room.<br>
**Arcadum**: It is filled with robes.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Looks like robes and candles for some kind of ritual, you know?<br>
**Claw**: I want to put one on, they will think I am one of them. Is there one that fits me?

> **Arcadum**: None of them fit you. It is at this point you hear this:

> **Voice**: (*Strange chanting*) You. Have. Tres. Passed.<br>

A cloaked creature with four candles appears behind the party.

> **Elwood**: We knocked and you said we could come in here!<br>
**Creature**: You. Have. Tres. Passed.<br>

The party inches closer to the figure.

> **Creature**: You. Have. Tres. Passed.<br>
**Tyrsis**: I am sorry we have trespassed in this place, we are looking for a way out of this place. We were transported here by accident. We would love to untrespass and be on our way back to Kalkatesh.<br>

> **Figure**: Escape. Is. Impossible.<br>
**Tyrsis**: That's the wrong kind of attitude. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it!

The creature walks right through Claw.

> **Claw**: Use your Cross use your Cross!

> **Arcadum**: You see that the creature is not talking to you, but to the sphere in the room.

> **Creature**: You. Have. Tres. Passed. You. Have. Tres. Passed.<br>
**Claw**: You. Have. Tres. Passed!<br>
**Creature**: You. Have. Tres. Passed. You. Have. Tres. Passed. Escape Is Impossible.<br>
**Dusty**: Why don't we find our way to the exit.

> **Arcadum**: A violet light will emerge from the sphere and lunges out at the figure. The figure will hold up a hand the light will stop. The creature will drain the light from the sphere until only a small sphere remains.

> **Creature**: You have trespassed.<br>
***Creature** destroys the orb in it's hand.<br>
**Tyrsis**: We need to be friends with this person. Very well done, honestly.<br>
**Gorrul**: Excuse me, can you hear us?

> **Arcadum**: The creature turns, as if it heard a voice and then looks back to the orb of souls. You see the creature has many arms, and in each of the arms is a blue Cross. On his chest is a necklace with a Blue cross that looks remarkably like the one Ulm holds.

> **Tyrsis**: Can you put on the Blue Cross?

> **Sivelle (Ulm)**: You know what. Are any of these robes small enough for a Goblin? You know what doesn't matter. Ulm will put on a robe.<br>
**Arcadum**: You put on a big floppy robe. It looks adorable. Ulm attempts to not trip on the robe she is wearing and walk up to the Creature.

> **Ulm**: "Uhh hello?!"<br>
***Creature** turns startled.<br>
**Creature**: You. Are. New.<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah, yeah. I'm new. What's up?<br>
**Creature**: You bear the mark, speak your purpose.<br>
**Ulm**: I'm trying to go back to the library, where the books are.<br>
**Creature**: Hm. You wish to escape from here?<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah! Yeah!<br>
**Gorrul**: Ask where are we?<br>
**Ulm**: Where are we?<br>
**Creature**: The Binding Without.<br>
**Gorrul**: Do you know where that is (Dusty)?<br>
**Dusty**: Umm.. I don't know.

> **Rhabby (Claw)**: Can we make a check?<br>
**Arcadum**: No.

> **Ulm**: The gods sent us on a mission. We need to get back to the library.<br>
**Creature**: Mission? What are you?<br>
**Ulm**: I'm a goblin.<br>
**Creature**: No, you are more.<br>
**Ulm**: I'm a goblin...<br>
**Gorrul**: He was destryoing the violet. Tell him you are a Seven!<br>
**Ulm**: I'm a Seven!

> **Arcadum**: Ulm's eye begins to light with violet light. The star pupil appears. The creature will stare at Ulm for a long time.

> **Creature**: You have lingered longer than the others, Seven. The torch is being passed. Speak. As is proper.

> **Arcadum**: Ulm shuts down, the eye is bright, and now the Soul within speaks.

> **Creature**: Traveler, your soul refracts many times. The dangers of your lingering, you know of them do you not? Why do you still linger?<br>
**Astral Traveler**: I have unfinished business.<br>
**Creature**: I will not question the wisdom of the Traveler. The red star still yet twinkles and I have lost my brother. If we are to gather, we must be found. Tell me Traveler, what of the handmaidens?<br>
**Astral Traveler**: They are there.<br>
**Creature**: Do they yet sleep?<br>
**Astral Traveler**: All but one.<br>
**Creature**: Then it has begun. My brother must be found. The cross must be complete. What of the Green?<br>
**Astral Traveler**: One has been found.<br>
**Creature**: We have fallen behind. My brother and I are out of place. We must be remade.<br>
**Astral Traveler**: Yes.<br>
**Creature**: Tell me Traveler, has the Indigo been found?<br>
**Astral Traveler**: No.<br>
**Creature**: Hmm. Then we yet still have time. I release thee now to attend to your duties. This one will find his brother. When the time comes the cross will not fail the prism.

> **Arcadum**: With that, Ulm returns to herself.

> **Tyrsis**: Are you okay Ulm?<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah I'm fine!<br>
**Elwood**: What the heck?<br>
**Tyrsis**: Should we return to the library?<br>
**Ulm**: Yeah!<br>
**Creature**: Halt Travelers!

> **Arcadum**: It seems the creature can see you now.

> **Creature**: What is your purpose for the cause?<br>
**Claw**: Uh, the Seven?<br>
**Gorrul**: We are companions, we seek the stones.<br>
**Creature**: Good good good, the stones will be needed. This one has a request for your consideration.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Okay..<br>
**Creature**: This one's brother must be found. Or rather, released from himself.<br>
**Gorrul**: What do your mean?<br>
**Creature**: My brother and I are the Blue Cross. There is much to understand, but little that is needed. My brother is corrupted and must be brought to heel. He lies trapped in a prison built of myself in the Twin Serpent. He wanders and watches and seeks to escape and continue his mad quest. Please, without my brother I am incomplete.<br>
**Gorrul**: If we are able to help you, will you be able to help us return to where we came?<br>
**Ulm**: We left someone and they are in danger.<br>
**Creature**: I can return you. Such an act is easy.<br>
**Claw**: See guys? Returning is easy nothing to worry about everything worked out.<br>
**Gorrul**: It seemed like you were able to dispell or destroy the violet light very easily. Is that something you can teach us?<br>
**Creature**: The Violet is powerful. But it can be controlled. It is said that Violet only serves one master. But like any tool it can be brought to heel with the proper will. But the traitorous one... The Violet... must be righted. The Prism is the only way. Time is against us. I will return you to whence you came. But please...please consider to return. I know not else whom I can call upon.<br>
**Ulm**: What's your brothers name?<br>
**Creature**: We do not have names. I am One of Two. As is he.<br>
**Gorrul**: Where would we find him?<br>
**One of Two**: He is within the mirrored realm.<br>
**Ulm**: Like that mirror that turned black in the other room?<br>
**One of Two**: Yes. But you must find a way to enter the mirrored realm. For not all can travel there. It is said that very few can. Those that share his bloodline can.<br>
**Gorrul**: How do we know if we have the bloodline?<br>
**One of Two**: Seek thee the changers of their shape. Seek the changelings. There is one that has already done so. It is what the Prism has said. She has already witnessed the serpent. She is far away. But my brother must be returned and the Cross restored. Seek her out. Find the Mirrored Realm. Defeat my Brother so that I may return whole.<br>
**Ulm**: Okay.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Should we do that now?<br>
**Ulm**: We need to find the stones! We will look while we are looking for the stones.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Can we we return here?<br>
**One of Two**: Yes you can return here, but please if you can not do it yourselves then please. Find someone who can. My brother must be returned to me or the prism fails.<br>
**Claw**: Do you have anything that can help us? (Ignored)<br>
**Tyrsis**: What is the room next to us with the black bits?<br>
**One of Two**: ...My brother is there.<br>
**Gorrul**: Is that how we get in?<br>
**One of Two**: It is hard to expain.<br>
**Claw**: My family has issues too.<br>
**Ulm**: We need to get back to the Library! We left someone important there and it is dangerous!<br>
**One of Two**: Very well. Your paths are your own to choose.<br>
**Tyrsis**: If you can get us to the library so easily, is there somewhere you can drop us off where we can find changelings to easily?<br>
**Ulm**: We can find that out at the Library, we need to go back to the Hatter and protect her. And Taffy!<br>
**One of Two**: Wait. The Hatter Mad? Oh joy, joyous... all is not lost.
>
> This one will return you. Keep her safe. Keep yor eyes watchful. Many will seek the Hatter Madd for her strength. There is one you should not give her two above all else..<br>
**Tyrsis**: Odin? Talven told us about that...<br>
**One of Two**: No. Odin is but a trifle.. Never. Never. Must be the Hatter Mad be corrupted. By the Violet.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Okay, we will make sure of that. Is there any tips to control the violet, just exude our will?<br>
**One of Two**: Strength.<br>
**One of Two**: You must go now. The prism depends on it.

The party teleports to the Library.
