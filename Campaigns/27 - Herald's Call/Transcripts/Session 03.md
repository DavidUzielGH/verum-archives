# Herald's Call -- Session 03

Aired: 11/01/2020

## Relevant Lore

Having just returned with the antidote and helped Jaxxon recover from his attack, the session picks up with Jaxxon speaking to the party about the Orange 5-pointed star key:
> **Jaxxon**: This artifact was thought to be lost to us, lost to my kind.<br>
**Jaxxon**: What you have faced is the order of the Shattered Star, it seems that the Enemy has begun to move. Whilst I dreamed, I dreamed of Despair. The poison did its terrible work, I feel that some of my strength is gone, and we are yet more at disadvant-<br>
***Ari** uses Soul Sight and looks at Jaxon and the room.

(Perceptions are rolled, `21(19)` highest.)

> **Arcadum**: The light around you seems to become brighter, like another layer has been added. Like the light is refracting, as if on a crystalline structure.<br>
The light begins to refract slightly, and the sound of a distant melody plays within the room. And since you are gazing directly at Jaxxon, you begin to see a few things happen. You notice his old, ragged scarred body, missing arm and other limbs, begin to softly heal. Jaxxon looks around with absolute astonishment, as such a thing is not only impossible, but beyond a thing he could even perceive as possible.

(This is Ari alone seeing it)

> **Arcadum**: As you continue to look at him, you will see that his smiling face, scarred and marred by burns and ripped flesh, begins to heal as well. And then finally, the light in the room refracts to show, just for a brief moment, the silhouette of a long dragon with crimson accents at the edge, and then around that white celestial scales. Almost like a rising dawn, the dragon coils around you, serpentine in its form, until finally, the light returns as it was, and the room becomes silent, and still, once more.<br>
**Ari**: Jaxxon, you're healed!<br>
**Party**: What did you see?<br>
**Ari**: He's healed... and is that a dragon?<br>
**Arcadum**: Jaxxon will take an arm that was not there before, and moves up and pulls back the hood, each of his followers gasping, as they have not seen his form before, until now.<br>
His face is still not fully healed, but enough of it is.<br>
And then he will speak, the etherealness gone from his voice:<br>
**Jaxxon**: It has been so long since I have spoken. So long. It would seem that we are not... we are not so far behind. Rejoice, my friends. For one of the Myths has been returned to its place.<br>
There are many things that need to be explained. First, we must secure this place. For if a Myth has returned, and now that my body has returned, the Enemy will not allow such a thing to go unpunished. Commander, see to it that we are protected. The rest of you, secure what supplies we have.<br>
**Jaxxon**: Come with me, these words should be for Torchbearers only.

(The party moves to Jaxxon's office)

> **Jaxxon**: Please, take a seat.<br>

(The party will lounge)

> **Jaxxon**: There is much to explain, and I will do what I can not to overwhelm you. But you have found yourself wrapped in the chaotic tides of a battle that is to come. The ebb and flow of which shatters mountains and twists skies.<br>
**Party**: Have you seen this battle before?<br>
**Jaxxon**: I have.<br>
**Party**: How old are you?<br>
**Jaxxon**: It is difficult to say, for in technicality, I have lost time.<br>
**Party**: How does one lose time?<br>
**Jaxxon**: First a proper introduction. I am called the Ember Lord, but I am no lord of embers. I believe they call me this due to the orange power, the color that I wield.<br>
**Party**: Color? The orange power like the goo?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Indeed, my friend.<br>
**Party**: The goo is from you?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes, it is.<br>
**Party**: The key was in the same color?<br>
**Jaxxon**: It was.<br>
**Party**: You wield the Amber?<br>
**Jaxxon**: No I do not wield the amber, that is for the Quadrinox and Amber Sky herself. They will the guardianship of time. I am one of five, I am one of the watchers. At least I was while my order was still standing.<br>
**Party**: What are you watching?<br>
**Jaxxon**: I can understand the confusion, the naming was not really our convention. We watched, we guarded. But  more so we served as the militant arm of the prism.<br>
**Party**: What happened to your eye?<br>
**Jaxxon**: There are some things that cannot be returned no matter how powerful the healing of such a being such as the Myth.<br>
There are some things of a cost that is paid too great. But allow me to explain. We are within the sixth iteration of this world's cycle. An iteration being an attempt to stop the power of the Enemy from destroying all things.<br>
**Party**: Who's The Enemy?<br>
**Arcadum**: Jaxxon will look at the druids question, and then will kind of look past her as if something that is standing behind her can be seen, almost as if he's looking at someone.<br>
**Jaxxon**: That is a question that I cannot answer for you. For some knowledge is too burdensome. The enemy that you face grows in its strength the more you know about it.

(Insight check: `20`, telling the truth.)

> **Party**: So this enemy, essentially, they have an army? They're growing stronger, does that mean you with the power you wield are in turn trying to build an army?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes. That is my purpose.<br>
**Party**: They want you dead for that?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes.<br>
**Party**: You say you are part of the Orange aspect of the prism, and the Violet is our enemy. What is the Prism? Are you all part of the same systems?<br>
**Jaxxon**: To understand what the Prism is first you must understand something else. And that is the nature of this world. Many walk through the land and live their lives and know not what they walk upon, what flows through their very bodies. What life is; I will not stray to philosophy and tell you only what I know for certain.<br>
What I know for certain is one: there is a dichotomy of Life and Death, and it is said that Lord Death is the guardian of Life, and the great tree that this life is representative of, branches and roots and grows. And it is within this realm, this concept, that Death formed seven Covenants, seven promises, to keep Life safe from its malignant touch.<br>
These Seven covenants form seven points, which in their placement form a shielding of our existence. A prism, if you will. And as such these covenants represent a concept, and within themselves a color.<br>
**Party**: Does that key have anything to do with the prism?<br>
**Party**: Why does the key we found have 5 points?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Each piece of the prism represents a convexing of allocation, a different perspective. There are many in their pieces, allow me to explain.<br>
**Party**: So what are the other colors and concepts?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Each of the colors represent an aspect of the Prism, and each of them are a different shape I suppose. They are the Red Star, which represents Wisdom, 6 points. Orange Star which represents Ambition, and has 5 points. There is the Yellow Quadrinox, a Square you might say, and it represents Time. There is the Green Triangle, it is representation of Life itself. The Blue Cross, which represents the Dream and its reflections. Then there is the Indigo Scar, which represents Death, and his promise. And finally there is the Violet, it is the broken covenant, it is the source of betrayal that we seek to correct with each iteration.<br>
**Party**: Has no iteration ever been successful?<br>
**Jaxxon**: No. Not in stopping it, in delaying it, perhaps. But never to stop. For the Enemy always returns, and each time more powerful than the last, for in each iteration more know of it that survive the cycle.<br>
**Ari**: Is this a good thing? You mentioned knowing more makes it more powerful?<br>
**Jaxxon**: That is a bad thing. For the more that we know of it the stronger it becomes.<br>
**Party**: Maybe you should be quiet then?<br>
**Jaxxon**: And hence the struggle. I do not know of the precise way, we hide our actions in secrecy, we obscure our meaning and purpose.<br>

> **Riku**: So, where the 7 pointed star is concerned, each color, time and all the things, is there a designated point to the star where it's represented?<br>
**Jaxxon**: What do you mean?<br>
**Riku**: If I'm looking at the star, and there's all of these things that it represents, is there a point on the star, is the time point a certain point on the star?<br>
**Riku**: We also saw another star, but it was just a 5 pointed star?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Indeed, the one that I wield.<br>
**Archael**: Death formed seven covenants which can be represented as a star, like the seven points of this covenant. Each point a different color representing a different aspect of Life, and each point conceptually has a shape with it.<br>
**Jaxxon**: That is correct<br>
**Party**: You represent the Orange, are the other colors friendly to you?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes, and yes. But we must be careful to never rest in one place, for the enemy constantly hunts for us.<br>

> **Party**: What do we do now?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Excellent, you are people of action, and there are many actions that we may yet take.<br>
**Arcadum**: Jaxxon will reach into his desk, and pull out a map, and place it onto the table.<br>
**Jaxxon**: One of my strengths is foresight. One of the few gifts that the Enemy was not able to claim, though it tried. It could not claim the power of the Seer, and already she has been able to depict to us its movements, and predict its arrival.<br>
The Enemy moves its forces in subtle ways, but not so subtle as not to be seen. As the towers fall, from the Herald's sight they shall be like beacons, and you will act as the arm of the Orange Star to destroy these places, and to prevent their blooming. For know this, when these towers are supplanted, should their violet bloom, all manner of horrible creatures shall answer the Herald's Call.

The group proceeds to have an out of character conversation about Sacrielâ€™s character, and how they might respond to learning about the Prism and the Enemy. How learning that there are things beyond the Gods, above them even, that it could definitely be a shock to someone so devout as Archael. Arcadum then hints towards Maxwell and how this revelation may have turned him from the path of Glory to following the Ember Lord.

> **Party**: Are all points of the star your enemy or just one?<br>
**Jaxxon**: No, we are all allied, except one. And that is the Traitor's color.<br>
**Party**: Even Indigo is an ally?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes.<br>

Referring to Violet:
> **Party**: Can we talk about this color?<br>
**Jaxxon**: You mustn't. Careful you must be to speak its name. The stronger you become the easier it will be in. In my presence you may speak, for my presence keeps us safe.<br>
***Jaxxon** reveals the orange star in the palm of his hand.<br>
**Jaxxon**: Say it again. Say the color's name.<br>
**Party**: Violet.<br>
**Arcadum**: When you say Violet you will see that there is a slight flash of the color across his palm, and the Orange star will dispel it.<br>
**Jaxxon**: However, there are limits to my strength, and words have power. And some have more power than others. The Herald possesses such strength in its title, but the name of the Enemy is the most powerful at all. Do not seek it, do not conjure it within your mind.<br>
**Party**: But what if we can control it?<br>
**Jaxxon**: There are many that believe that they could, and it's true that the Violet is a source of strength for any to use, but it has always served one master, and only Seven have wielded it to any effect, but their cost has been paid for its use, each and every time.<br>
**Party**: If Violet is a horrible color then why is your eye also Violet, and your scar for that matter.<br>
**Jaxxon**: The eye allows one to see color, it is the source of our strength. In my youth I had thought to have the strength to wield the Violet, but I was wrong. And my brothers paid for it, I cut from my-<br>
**Party**: who are your brothers<br>
**Jaxxon**: The other five, or four I should say, if I am to ever count myself among them.<br>
**Party**: You mean the other people representing the other colors?<br>
**Jaxxon**: No the others of the star, the Orange.<br>
**Party**: So four of them remain?<br>
**Jaxxon**: No they are all perished, I am the last of the five.<br>
**Party**: Did they all die?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes.<br>
**Party**: The artifact we found regained your power, can we use it for them?<br>
**Jaxxon**: That is why it is so joyous, for you see.<br>
**Arcadum**: He pulls out his Orange key. It looks the same as the one Midas has, except a different point of the star glows with Orange.<br>
**Party**: So if your brothers and sister represent the five points on that star, then the points on the other color are how many are in the other color?<br>
**Jaxxon**: You are a sharp girl, yes. For the most part.<br>
**Party**: So the key we found was specific to your existence?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes, or my order, I suppose.<br>
**Party**: Can we use the key you showed us to gain more allies?<br>
**Jaxxon**: I intend to bequeath it upon you. Now you have two of five.<br>
***Jaxxon** hands the party the key.<br>
**Party**: Is the key we used to revive you not spent?<br>

(OOC)
> **Arcadum**: The antidote did that.<br>
**Party**: What was the dragon blooming about?<br>
**Arcadum**: That was about a completely other event that will be explained in a moment.

(IC)

> **Arcadum**: As Midas takes the key, suddenly there is a kind of contorting shaking of magic, and the two keys merge together, and now two points are glowing on the key. The two keys become one, with two out of five lit.<br>
**Party**: Where can we find more keys?<br>
**Jaxxon**: I did not think it was possible to find them, I thought they were lost. But it would seem that the Matron has a different plan.<br>
***Jaxxon** will point at the map.<br>
**Jaxxon**: The Seer has shown us the Enemy's movements, and I believe that since you have found the key through a shroud of Violet, that the Enemy knows where they are, and we can use the Enemy to lead us to them.<br>
**Party**: How would we start doing that?<br>
**Party**: Are we aware of any more presence of the Shattered Seven Star that we might explore?<br>
**Jaxxon**: The Order of the Shattered Star are agents of the Enemy, but they don't know it. They move to its bidding, hidden from most sights. But the Seer is on our side, and this-<br>
***Jaxxon** points to Crestfall in Orde.<br>
**Jaxxon**: Is where we believe the first of these towers to fall.<br>
**Party**: So the Enemy is going to summon towers, but it has not done so yet. But the powers of the seer which you can ask about, has revealed to the good guys where the Violet plans to go next.<br>
**Party**: Who is this Seer you speak of?<br>
**Jaxxon**: She is known as the Oracle by the Vegan people, one of the few that see Time for its true shape, or perhaps concept. The sight of the Cyclops has always confused me.<br>
**Party**: Does she represent the Orange order?<br>
**Jaxxon**: She does not.<br>
**Party**: Does she represent any order?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Only her people, the Vega.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Your party does not know of the Vega.

> **Ari**: The Vega you speak of, are they similar to the followers of the Matron of Fate?<br>
**Jaxxon**: They are, I suppose you might call them the first humans, the humans that were not created by Dragonborn. They are not of Cassius, but rather of the Cyclops.<br>
**Party**: How did such a thing come to be? Are they still around? Where are they? How can we find this Seer?<br>
**Jaxxon**: The Seer is found from the Vegan islands, not far from Majital.<br>
**Party**: You spoke of the Towers, if the Seer knows of a tower already is it not better that we focus on the tower rather than the Seer itself?<br>
**Jaxxon**: That was the idea, he points at the map.<br>
**Party**: Should we visit this first tower, do we have your blessing?<br>
**Jaxxon**: That was the intention, but we are not ready to send you. There is one pitfall. The tower is to be conjured within Orde, by Crestfall. According to this it is to be summoned in the city itself. The problem is that Crestfall is one of the highest population cities in Kalkatesh. I fear the White Council may be compromised. It is strange to describe, I know some of their families.<br>
The White Council is stuffy perhaps, but they are committed to their people. Lately the rumors I've heard are that they have become stagnant, uncaring. It is true our Enemy manipulates unseen and in shadow, I fear the white council may be corrupted, but we do not have time to find the corruption. We must stop the Tower, and you all must serve as the militant arm of the Orange Star.<br>
Before that begins you will need passage, and a mission in Orde. There is one contact I have that has recently arrived in Fireport, if you would go see her for me. She is a servant of the Seven, and is an ally to our cause.

> **Party**: We found this note when we were attacking people.<br>
***Party** hands note to Jaxxon.<br>
**Arcadum**: As he takes the note and reads it carefully, he will then nod as if he's not quite surprised.<br>
**Jaxxon**: This confirms my fears. The Order of the Shattered Star has infiltrated the White Council, then we must fall to only other holy order there, and we have to hope it is not corrupted.<br>
**Party**: You seem to not be surprised by the traitor, do you have an idea of who it is on the council?<br>
It mentions the magistrate.<br>
**Jaxxon**: I personally do not know whom this traitor could be, but it is the only thing that explains the behavior.<br>
**Party**: If we find the traitor what should we do?<br>
**Jaxxon**: We are at war.

> **Jaxxon**: Now, before you can make your way to Crestfall, you must seek the passage with our ally. You will find her at the trading house within the city, I have made arrangements to see that you meet them.<br>
**Arcadum**: This entire time Jaxxon and the contact have been casting spells behind the party's back.<br>
Jaxxon will summon a symbol, then replicate it 6 times, and hand each of you a lapel of an orange star with a blazing fire in the center.<br>
**Jaxxon**: These are the symbols of the order, wear them. For now you are one of us.<br>
> **Ari**: Forgive my ignorance, Jaxxon. I keep coming back to this thought of the Enemy being, in a way, a part of this Seven? Is there truly no instance of anyone being successful? Do you believe there is a way to destroy it? Or do you think we'll be staving it off eternally?<br>
**Jaxxon**: My thoughts have often strayed to the nihilistic side and futility. But it is within my belief that there is one thing that deserves our faith, and that is Hope. Hope that this time we will be victorious, Hope that eventually the Enemy will fail. For the Enemy wields despair, and the only thing that can dispel despair is Hope. I have my faith.<br>
***Party** puts the lapels on.<br>
**Ari**: Jaxxon, before when you were healing from the power of the key that you were holding, it seemed to me like there was a dragon? I'm just so... it was beautiful.<br>
**Jaxxon**: You see, it is not the turn of the key that restored my strength, but rather even greater news. It seems that our comrades, the other Prisms and their servants have performed a most wonderous deed. For one of the Myths have been awoken and unsealed from their fates.<br>
**Party**: Is a Myth a dragon?<br>
**Jaxxon**: This one is, yes. I was never graced with its name, but I know of it.<br>
**Party**: Are they here to help us?<br>
**Jaxxon**: Yes, they are one of the greatest allies we could ever call upon.<br>
**Ari**: Then Hope is here.<br>
**Jaxxon**: Indeed.

### Return to Town

The party re-enters the city through the northern gate, and heads to the trading house. Party was told to seek a person with a visage of iron.

They meet Gambell Gotte -- Morose Airship Captain. The party will ambush Gambell, and question what he says.

> **Gambell**: You see, I have recently come into bad straits, my ship was lost, you see. And now I find myself stranded in Orde, and no one is in need of my services.<br>
**Party**: What services?<br>
**Gambell**: I'm a pilot you see, Captain Gambell Gotte, of the Lavender Lady. At least I was, before it was lost.<br>
**Party**: How did you lose your ship?<br>
**Gambell**: I gambled it away.

Gambell mentions he pays his tithes to Babylon & is from Khao. He continues on with his story and says he lost his ship to a cocksure man, simply by the roll of the dice. Party contemplates helping Gambell, and in return he'll be their airship captain.

The man who now holds the deed to Gambell's airship is in the trading house at the moment.

> **Party**: You mentioned all of this was hinged on the rolling of a die, was it yours?<br>
**Gambell**: I believe it was the house die? You think I was cheated?<br>
**Ari**: It's always possible with these situations.<br>
**Party**: Why did the guy want an airship?<br>
**Gambell**: He was just a braggart. I was goaded into it. I think he just wanted what was mine. An airship is afterall something most never seen in their lives, let alone own.<br>
**Archael**:  What do you think it's worth?<br>
**Gambell**: A countryman offered me 70,000 gold pieces, but I couldn't part with the lady, she was my only...<br>
**Party**: What were you trying to win?<br>
**Gambell**: The affection of the people, but also, something valuable.<br>
**Party**: Like what?<br>
**Gambell**: Well, you see, uh. Well, it was... it was a contract.<br>
**Archael**:  Of what nature?<br>
**Gambell**: To an outsider.<br>
**Party**: An outsider from where?<br>
**Gambell**: A succubi...

### The Trading House

The party is met with [Alustious House (Madame of Coin)](https://i.imgur.com/KmYUWfD.jpg) who introduces herself as someone in charge of this trading house. They inquire if she knows anyone who fits a description of the man Gambell described. She points out a man off to the side seated on a couch.

The party confronts him. A foul beast with horns (Tiefling?) and a wide brimmed hat. A charcoal gray hat, slight alterations to the back.

He eventually introduces himself as Lucius Lenitio (Warlock of Khao).

Ari Soul Sights Lucius. He is completely and utterly obscured by black clouds of shadow.

(10 perception from Archael)

> **Arcadum**: You will see that this individual wears a common garb of Khaoans. You can also see that he is pretty opulatently dressed, you will see he bears a lapel of Dolten on the front.

Lucius is revealed to be a Warlock of the Gambler Black. The group talks with Lucius and tries to find a way to get the airship. Lucius will offer the airship in exchange for the party delivering an item for him.

Group asks for clarification on the item Lucius needs delivered, and the Archael stipulates that he won't break the law for him.

> **Lucius**: In Dolten, my kind are considered second-hand citizens. They're not much more than slaves. The cargo you'll be carrying is to my people who want to be free from such prejudice. So, Paladin, would you be willing to break the law in order to free children?

(Party rolls Insight, highest 23, and reveals Lucius is telling the complete truth)

Lucius will give them three days to decide.

---

Returning to Alustious, she confirms that the visage of iron the party is looking for is [Kalla'Jin](https://i.imgur.com/4sP0fv0.jpg). She shows them to a former counting room in the trading house where Kalla'Jin awaits.

Ari Soul sights Kalla'Jin:
> **Arcadum**: As you look upon Kalla'Jin you will see that Kalla'Jin is a molten elemental humanoid of silver flame and righteous fury. An enormous mark of the Seven is etched into the creature, and as you look at the creature's visage, it looks at you.

Kalla'Jin warns Ari to be careful who/what she uses that Sight on and the conversation continues. Eventually she will reveal:
> **Kallaâ€™Jin**: I would seem that, while I was wandering these Strange Roads, my position of Inquisitor was taken from me.<br>
**Party**: Who stripped your title from you?<br>
**Kallaâ€™Jin**: The White Council, and indeed, they went above my superiors. My Chaptermaster was not even informed. 

The party hands over the letter about the corrupt magistrate to Kallaâ€™Jin.

Kalla'Jin is sending the party to meet a cleric of Vavren, Basen. Basen can be found in Crestfall. Kalla'Jin requests they convince the local government to evacuate the city or find a way to evacuate the city themselves. The tower will fall within the fortnight.

Kalla'Jin will hand each member of the party a superior healing potion. And will give Archael one of her swords:
> **Kalla'Jin**: I can see that you wield the spear, and that is a fine weapon. But at the very least, consider having this at your side. I have received a premonition that my fighting days are behind me, and I would hate to see my weapons retire with me.<br>
This blade was given to me by the greatest duelist Kalkatesh has ever known, Iltanen Oronoscorenzie, and the sword's name is Forbiddance.

Kalla'Jin says she must journey to meet with another group, not far that will be walking a similar route.

All but Midas leaves the room they met Kalla'Jin in and he searches for money. He finds none, but instead finds a scroll. The scroll contains a wisp of Orange light:
> **Arcadum**: As you reach for the scroll and grasp to pull it free, you will see that there is Orange script on the side of it. From the back of the scroll, written in an ink that only a wielder of an orange key can read is the following:
>
> Take pride, for you have found your path. Denote this to the one known as Jaxxon, we are the key, and we speak through forgotten things.

---

Party speaks with Alustious again, learns that she made the deal with Lucius to get an airship. However, he recently backed out on the deal (because the party intervened). The party reworks a deal to get her the airship back to her after theyâ€™re done with it in exchange for 7000 gold.

Party goes to speak with Lucius and give him the updates.

End of session.
