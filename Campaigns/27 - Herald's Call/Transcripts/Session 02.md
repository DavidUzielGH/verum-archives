# Herald's Call -- Session 02

Aired: 10/24/2020

Party proceeds to hunt down the group believed to be responsible for the assassination attempt against The Ember Lord, the leader of the group who had summoned them.

## Relevant Lore

Party finds tracks, rolls survival to follow them. Midas rolls nat 20. Party heads to the north and soon arrives at an encampment.

**Dark Iron Warrior** - Mercenaries. Various crossed out symbols on the uniforms. Faded symbol on their chest, the chest symbol is that of a shattered 7-pointed star.<br>
**Darx Dark Iron** - Leader of the group. Black iron sword over his back, it appears to be massive. Child named Lorita, after the goddess herself, child was taken from him. Remembers her laugh, waking up in cold sweat thinking she's next to him.

Shattered symbol of the Seven was not on Analus, or the map she had.

Party decides to stealth around the edge of camp and see what they can find by sneaking into the tents while the residents of the camp are distracted by their leader's tales of family.

Ari finds a bundle of documents in the bottom-left tent, and snags the documents and heads out.<br>
Azylea finds bundles of crossbow bolts in the bottom-right tent.

---

Two reinforcements come in from the south.<br>
> **Captain**: Report from the south.<br>
> **Dark Iron 7/8**: Karakel(sp?) has taken position in the south, with Jaxon's death we have a real shot of moving forward.

---

**Documents**: Ciphered, but appear to be a list of orders. You can make out the following:
> **Arcadum**: One of the documents is a ledger of supplies, food, water, things like that. These are in common language. What you are able to determine is the supplies have all been ordered from the same place, and the name of that place is Hector's Hymn, a great inn located in Steton.

Cipher is written in Thieves Cant, Ari can read it:
> **Arcadum**: According to the speech here, there is a traitor in Fireport. One of the council members, whose name is not written down, has been providing these individuals direct support.

**Top-right Tent (Riku)**: Captain's tent. Anvil, smithing tools. Another ledger, that deals with the blacksmiths supplies. However, there are two other things:
* One is a torn-up piece of parchment `"The Unwise Six, come one come all, an extravaganza of senses!"`
* A holy symbol of the Seven, however the points of the star have been torn off, and all of your senses of danger begin to sound off, because in the center of the star you see the tiniest wisp of Violet light.

Party engages the residents of the encampent & wins. They find the antidote on the Captain, 100gp, and a small silver chest that is locked tight. Chest contains a pair of wedding rings, a lock of a little girl's hair, and a hastily scrawled note that is still stained with blood. Note says:
> To my beloved Darx, please do not grow sour while you are away, we know will return soon and we know that you will so-

Archael uses Divine Sense to examine the violet star:
> **Arcadum**: A sort of psionic feedback will screech through your mind and disrupt your ability to detect it. Whatever it is, it knows you're watching it somehow.

Arcana check, 19 highest: 
> **Arcadum**: Riku, as you study the foreboding color closely you begin to understand its nature a little bit more. This symbol was desecrated and broken by mortal hands, but the corruption, the Violet light is being summoned forth from inside of it. There is something inside the star, but you will have to break the rest of it to get to it.

Midas identifies it.

> **Arcadum**: Midas I speak now to you and you alone.<br>
The secret within the shattered star. You begin to see many different things.<br>
As you take a closer look, slowly, a sense of foreboding eeks over you in washing waves, and then you are suddenly pulled in towards it, without your will to guide you, without the consent of your strength. You are pulled down inside, and all around you, you see the strength of the herald flow through this point, through the Shattered Star, all around you you see visions of its malignant will, and you see it scorch across the sky.<br>
Visions of what yet is to come flash through your mind. The summoning of Violet servants, going out into the world and claiming souls, turning all into naught but ash. And then finally, the Herald reaches its destination and plummets down into the continent of Kalkatesh, wiping life from the continent in one vicious blow.
>
> However, make for me a Wisdom saving throw. (11 Wisdom save)
>
> Alright, you start to get some of your balance back, refocus, the power of the Violet light begins to even out as your Soulfire begins to burn. And for a brief moment, you can see through to the other side, something hidden through the light, and just on the other end you see the silhouette of a key. Do you reach for it?<br>
**Midas**: Yeah, I do.<br>
**Arcadum**: Midas. You reach toward the key, all around you power surges, should you miscalculate just for a moment your body will be torn asunder. The Violet light moves around you, like the cascade of a hurricane, but you grasp the key, you grip it tightly, and then, as quickly as it began. It ends. And the vision stops, the magic fades, and in your hand there is a key.
>
> **Midas**: What's the key look like?<br>
**Arcadum**: As you open your hand, not realizing that you had squeezed it tight, you look at your key and you see that it is a simple brass key, in the pommel there is the etching of a five-pointed star, and one section glows with a bright orange light, and four yet remain.

Back at The Ember Lord's "base" the party will hand the antidote to Alehandro, who feeds it to Jaxon. It will take time for Jaxon to recover, but heâ€™s getting better.

The party informs Alehandro Dekon of the key.

> **Alehandro**: Where did you find this?<br>
**Archael**: There was an artifact that I observed with my divine sense, butit crippled me, and Midas had the fortitude to touch the artifact, and he can tell the rest.<br>
**Midas**: I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and I had a vision of the world ending, and a key. I turned the key, and the key was in my hands.<br>
**Alehandro**: This is ancient, perhaps as old as Jaxon itself.<br>
**Alehandro**: Did you find out anything about the assailants themselves?<br>
**Archael**: They have access to a traitor in Fireport.<br>
**Ari**: Their sigil was the seven pointed star, but every point on it was shattered. There was a piece of parchment, this is how the key came to be, there was the same symbol, and in the center was a small violet light.<br>

> **Maxwell**: It seems the enemy has already begun. It seems that the order of the Shattered Star has returned.<br>
**Party**: Have you fought them before?<br>
**Maxwell**:I haven't but my grandfather has.<br>
**Archael**: Will this key offer us an advantage?<br>
**Maxwell**: Indeed, it will allow us to find Jaxon's home, once he has returned he might be able to return to his truest form, and we have a powerful ally against the enemy.<br>

(Party hits level 2)

> **Party**: Does that mean the wisp of Violet light has dissipated?<br>
**Arcadum**: No.<br>
**Party**: So we still have it, got it.<br>
**Ari**: Midas do you still have the parchment with the star with the violet light?<br>

(No one touched or brought the star with the violet light.)

> **Party**: Why did one have seven points, but the key has five points?
Maxwell: Perhaps it is time to inform you of the Prism, which I will do so next session.

Party will inform Maxwell of the location of the camp with the broken violet star in it.
