# Herald's Call -- Session 04

Aired: 11/07/2020

## Relevant Lore

In preperation of the "delivery" mission the group has Lucius contract a priest of Kaheeli for a travel boon for the trip to Dolten. He expects, with the boon, the trip will take about a week on weather condition. The Violet Tower will fall in a fortnight, so this takes up half their time.

Priest is paid for via the wedding bands of the Order of the Shattered Star mercenaries they killed.

---

The party, knowing they have a day to kill decides to "long rest"/nap in the Trading House.

During this time the ladies decide to wander off for a blacksmith. Eventually they find one within the Trading House:

Rammelstein - Orcish Blacksmith<br>

They both acquire some new gear from the rather flamboyant, but very friendly, Orc. During the interaction Rammelstein plays on a musical instrument similar to a didjeridu. The sound of this somehow attracts Riku's attention and he stops by to give it a play himself.

### The Airship: Lavender Lady

The party meets up with Lucius and hears back that the blessing allows for travel to Dolten in 5 days, and back in 3. Cargo will slow them down, might make it take 6 days, leading to 11 of 14 days used in travel alone.

In an attempt to have a plan in place if timing should go awry, Archael speaks with Gambell to verify that, worst case scenario, Gambell will have their backs when they need to go to Crestfall.

---

As the party begins exploring the airship Midas makes his way into the engine room:
> **Arcadum**: Symbol on the right pipe that glows with divinity and not arcane. It is the symbol of Sekelcuse, the god of thieves.<br>
Gabmell keeps meticulous records of his ships' travels. It has been all across Kalkatesh. There is one other thing you notice, one of the parchments seems to be ciphered in a way, as if coded.

(`18(15)` Intelligence check)

> **Arcadum**: The parchments are written in Thieves Cant. Midas, you are not able to read it but able to determine what it is. What you can determine is that it seems to be indicating the true route of the airship, which leads you to believe all the other records are false.

Midas goes and finds Ariene & Archael to help him decipher what he found in the Engine Room and leads them back that way:

> **Arcadum**: Gambell's spryness and quickness indicates more than his passion. Gambell, it would seem, was once an accomplished thief in direct service to Sekelcuse. He was also a Gregorian rogue, and as reward for his long years of service he was given an airship from the priests of Sekelcuse themselves.<br>
The first place the ship left was Crestfall, and it left in the middle of the night.<br>
He did perform duties as a smuggler for Sekelcuse from time to time. drugs, wine, beasts.

(`17` Investigation for hidden compartments)

> **Arcadum**: Hidden compartment in the fuel source. One of the canisters contains a stash of rare dragon weed. Valued at 2k-4k gold.

---

Back up on deck the party heads off flying to Dolten and the children they are to help.

Arcadum rolls for events day by day. On day 3 or 4 a storm event occurs and the airship gains ground as the net result. Still took 5 days to arrive in Dolten. 5/14 days passed until the Violet Tower appears.

### Dolten -- Meeting Place

The party arrives and it appears early as there is no one awaiting them at the pre-arranged meeting spot Lucien directed them towards.

Time passes and Lucien begins to grow more and more worried. These are the forests of Dalton, after all. All manner of dark and creepy, crawly exist here. And nowhere is truly safe in these woods.

Eventually, thankfully, a figure appears at the edge of the clearing to the north:<br>
**Captain Lucien Lorant - Hkari**:<br>

Ari True Sights the Captain:
> **Arcadum**: He carries a morose soul. His soul is steeped in sadness and regret, his failures like chains holding him down.

The Captain and the children in tow make their way to the ship after a brief discussion between Lorant & Lucien. Lorant reveals that some of the children are sick and need help.

The party rolls medicine checks and helps tend to the two sick children while the rest are being loaded onto the airship.

However.

Violet light strikes into a nearby tree, and everyone doubles over in pain. Violet lights begin to appear in the treeline.

Lorant steps forward offering to take on this enemy himself and buy everyone time to get away.

Arcadum gives the party the option to leave, leaving Lorant to die, but freely save the children. Or assist Lorant in defeating the Violet to gain 2 Order.

#### The Party's First Violet Encounter
(Morgetaâ€™s [Violet Encounter Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N9u0z3Oyl_LfKrIsaZjJwSQACZOlGL5ZNrzLCxTcWWI))

Martial checks reveal that The Violet enemies are in pursuit of the children. Every child that is abducted and pulled to the edge of the map will reward the Enemy with 1 Entropy.

After a number of rounds go by another presence comes out of the treeline. Something a bit stronger. Something more in charge:

**Listless Lament**:<br>
