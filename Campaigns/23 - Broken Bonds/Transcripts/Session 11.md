## Relevant Lore

Wandering through the woods, they come upon a strange mass...

### The Morhg

Looks like the base, a skeleton with squirming intestines. On its skull, a single line, like a cross. One of the pieces of the cross is filled in (vertical), the other is not. The color has faded. Does appear to look azure. The skeleton is faded from white into black at the edges. The intestines are more of an orange than the pink on the art. The creature has some clothing in it. A single black shawl across its neck, at the edge and fringes, slight red markings.

**The "Birth"**

The "egg" sack withers away.

The creature will grasp at you, and catch it.<br>
**(nat 20) **E'ar basically tames the Morhg.

It will speak:

> **Mohrg**: who awakens me?<br>
**E’ar**: hi honey, i thought you were gonna be furry or a butterfly or something<br>
**Mohrg**: What?<br>
**E'ar**: What are you<br>
**Mohrg**: I am tender of graves one of two to rot and pain, but I have forgotten my name.<br>
**E'ar**: Would you like your new name to be Zoro?<br>
**Mohrg**: This one is Zorro?<br>
**E'ar**: If you want, until you<br>
**Mohrg**: This one will be Zorro<br>

The creature will shy away from your touch, as you touch it on its intestines, it burns in pain.

>**Zorro**: Touch not, your kind heart harms me.<br>
**E'ar**: Do you want me to be mean to you?<br>
**Zorro**: You have no evil in your heart, pain will be my upon our touch. when you have freed me such things must be recompensed.<br>
**E'ar**: What's the reward?<br>

The creature will look to you with empty eyes.

>**Zorro**: Are you sure you wish for it?<br>
**E'ar**: Yes...<br>
**Zorro**: So be it.<br>

The skeletal hand will place itself on E'ar's forehead. Arcadum will have fun.

This creature possess within its ability as a guardian of the prism (Blue Cross) to make for itself those that would assist it in its duties. In this case specifically a Shrinemaiden.

(More along the lines of Jiangshi.)

#### Changes to E’ar:
Her blue watery hair turns to black ichor. Her eyes specifically change, their pupils to become very very narrow, and there is a symbol. Arcadum draws it in maptools:

#### Description of Shrinemaiden Garb:
A hakama, only real requirements are: Golden sash that is wrapped around the shoulder, or waist. One glove. A glove is important because the glove has a black onyx shard in it, which gives her access to the powers of undeath.

>**Zorro**: I must find the other. Help me do this please?<br>
**E'ar**: Find the others?<br>
**Nox**: What happens when that happens?<br>
**Zorro**: The prism must be completed, the enemy must be stopped. The traitor must pay the price.<br>
**Nox**: Your enemy, or our enemy?<br>
***Zorro** points to the sky<br>
**Nox**: Understood.<br>

The missing piece of One of Two, just finding him means you have added 5 Order to the world.

Order and entropy represent the scoreboard. Everytime the hero's fail, the enemy gains entropy.

Order is the resource the heroes get, lets you directly combat the violet, or in this case, unlock secrets or weapons to use against it. as such here as you survived touching such a creature, and for some reason it all worked out. You have found one of the missing pieces of the guardians of the prism, so that means the blue cross is complete.

You have found one of the win conditions for Kalkatesh.

The Green Triangle are the Rotted Lords and the Blue Cross has an explanation as to why he's a Mohrg.

This creature has existed for 10 years.

>**Zorro**: I must seek passage to a place with someone that can contact my missing brother. Can you assist me?

He will lean against E’ar as he can barely walk, as he was just born.

E'ar with her new prestige class chooses to now go by "`Fe'ar`".

### Tomen's Mirror
The mirror radiates power of dream, but in a different manner. It also seems like through a different filter. It isn't the power of the dream, but the power that makes the dream, the reflection of memory itself. As a dream guardian this is what we like to call in the business off-putting.


>**Nox**: A vision I had seen. I was to meet with him, I'm not sure why. I'm not quite sure unless he has insight?<br>
**Tomen**: I believe I understand why. It would seem that pieces are falling into place, and that soon the isles will be revealed, and those that are to be sent there must have knowledge of what they are. Tell me Nox, have you been to the encampment?<br>
**Nox**: No<br>
**Tomen**: It soon begins then. There is one such eye in your company. It must be protected so that it may serve its purpose soon. there is another as well, yet wayward, that waits within solemn. they must both be collected and go to the camp. For soon, perhaps the labyrinth will be defeated, then it will be upon us all. for now keep safe this eye, but be warned, guardian. There are forces that move just beyond sight, the order of the ember lord has begun recruitment again, and they have already been targeted. I have seen it through my mirrors. there is... something else, a madness that is taking hold in places that I cannot see, and spaces I cannot hear. There are shadows that move through the enemy's eye, you must keep the eye safe.<br>
Keep them all safe, I have duties that I must return to. Bryan, and with it, I fear, a terrible price to be paid.<br>

### Bryan's Scythe

>**Nox**: Can I see that scythe again?

Nox is handed the scythe.

>**Mimika (Nox)**: Can she use the catalyst to ask wode what exactly it is, or any other information on it?<br>
> **Arcadum**: As you attempt to do so you feel as if that power is forgotten. (Waking world and de-leveled here.)
