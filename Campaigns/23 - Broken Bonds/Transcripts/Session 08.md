### A Violet Eye

The party travels to a statue in honor of The Seven. A pedestal is there and Remag steps forward. (Note: This is also technically a Sevenic Speech)

> **Arcadum**: Remag, as you place your hand on the pedestal there is a flash of violet light. The seven-pointed star will expand outwards all around you. Your party seems to bleed away into an array of colors as time slows to a stopping halt. The mountains fade away and all that stands before you is the infinite shadow and the shining point of violet light. Your hand begins to flow with strength, straight up your arm. All the way up towards your right eye. It opens. Age seems to fade away from this side of your face. Your eye begins to surge with strength as the star enters through your eye. That which was a single pupil instead is refracted into a seven-pointed star.
>
> And you see them now, the shadows of the seven. All around you. They raise their hands up towards you. The shadows reflecting. Refracting. Moving towards you at once like a wave, after wave, of energy. They move towards you and then slowly stand where you stand. They stand beside you, in front of you, each one mimicking your action. And you see it. Reflected each time it has came before, the six other eyes that are yet still open with you, and now you join them as the seventh. And within the center, there is a violet light that grows in strength.
>
> The Herald's presence moves across the celestial skies and towards that of Kalkatesh. And then, there is a calm peace for but a moment. As you stand with your six fellows, each one like you, a traveler on an errant road, finding your way, making your path. But all these things bleed away as a single purpose rises up within your heart. You can see it now. The purpose and burden of those that came before and those that must come after for the torch has been passed. And then, slowly, like a rising sun, the seven-pointed star reveals more to you. Behind you, there is the past, and all the seven that had came before and all those that had fought the enemy.
>
> And ahead of you, the golden tapestry of fate rises up swirling in a celestial wind, frayed at its edges, torn and taught. And in the center a wrongness erupts out, ripping and tearing leaving nothing but void and nothing. The violet light grows in strength, but you do not stand alone. For at your side are your companions as well. They place their hands upon your shell. You do not stand alone. But neither are all of you alone. For beside you, down the line, like solders amassed for battle are six other refractions. You are the same, but different. Common, yet unique. And like the shadow vibrating between form, and felt. There it is before you. Truth. And the truth is, that the time that Raquel tries her very hardest to keep safe, is filtering away. The great wheel begins to turn, and soon the end of things will be upon us all.
>
> But, there is always one light in the dark, one tiny thread that has yet to be snapped, and that is the thread of hope. The thread that you now hold in your hand along with the others. Your eye kind of expands outwards, revealing more of the things that you must do. You can see there is an island, a labyrinth. You can see a great shadow of a wizard fighting against three groups of your fellows. You can see travelers moving towards the mountains, whomst paths you have just crossed with. You can also see those that seek the stones hidden from faraway. Your hand touches your neck, for now that your bonds are broken, what will you do with your freedom? Around you, voices begin to sing slightly. Quietly at first, as if whispering instruction, the voices of those that came before. They stand beside you, they tell you what you must do. The Herald beckons. Your bonds are broken. And now, the true battle begins. For without you, the star is incomplete. Without your companions you cannot do it alone. And together, only together, can there be hope where there was once despair. With that lifted up within you, Remag feels his shell begin to shift and change. As he bears the runes of the master, so to do the seven impart their wisdom. His mind fills with knowledge, knowledge of the runes of The Seven, and of the one rune mage who came before who held within the cube of the oscillator. All those things that are hidden away. And as such, you now know what you must do. For as one library has been found, there is yet one more place that requires the presence of the eye.
>
> It rises up ahead of you now, your purpose made clear, no longer errant in mystery or hidden in shadow. It rises up to a singular point. You must now travel to the holy cities of Orde, where the white pantheon hold disdain and they hold proclaim. And there you must walk a path of which the Inquisition has left behind and you must find the sacred relics. For within them there lies a secret to The Enemy's defeat. A secret to embolden your allies, a secret to tip the scale of the war. And so, with step by step, you move down a celestial path. Beside you, your companions walk with you. Together, you move forward. They sing within the light of your soul, emboldened, strengthened, no longer afraid, no longer a prisoner, no longer bound. Your destiny is your own, and it awaits you. So I wonder, are you ready for what is to come?

> **Michael (Remag)**: Hell yes!
