# Tearing Veil -- Session 07

Aired: 11/13/2020

Having completed their shopping the party rolls up to the docks in front of the trading house and speaks once again with their contact, Bennex O'Brian.

## Relevant Lore

Using the item they got off the captain at the hidden temple of Glory, Bennex extracts a thread of some sort and explains it can help hide their "nature" and the stealthy/silver-tounged one should sneak in and find a symbol of the Seven wreathed in flame.

Bennex wraps the thread around Wisp's wrist and the party discusses about disguises and the best way to get inside.

(Also some bickering about gods, worship, and self-importance between Nidhogg and Angorn)

Wisp heads in under the guise of an inspector of the trading house. She eventually meets the owner, Alustious House, and tries to convince her of this deception. Something she is incredibly skeptical about being she would have known of an inspector being sent, surely?

Wisp (after Devin makes a history check `14`) claims to be from the Sapphire Soverign trading company. This seems to be enough to convince Alustious who then goes off to find some documents.

While seated and waiting for someone to come by, Wisp (perception check `17(15)`) spots someone with the bearings of an Inquisitor. She sees Kalla'Jin who walks up to the front desk and discusses something (perception check `4(2)`) but Wisp is unable to hear what is beind said.

She eventually decides to sneak into the room Kalla'Jin came from. An old store room. Moving around, looking for signs of recently disturbed items to give a clue as to what to look for, Wisp eventually finds herself walking into what appears to be an unused counting office. As she starts to investigate a noise from the main door is heard.

(Stealth check `20(19)`)

Wisp sits down in one of the chairs as someone enters the room.

> **Kalla'Jin**: Oh. I certainly did not expect visitors. Tell me. What is your name and why are you here?

(Devin makes a History check `20(19)` & Religion check `6(5)`)

> **Wisp**: Inquisitor Kalla'Jin, well met. She is Wisp of the Unwise Six.<br>
> **Kalla'Jin**: Yes. I have heard of your... circus. How strange that a thespian would find their way into my quarters, and without announcement. Very well.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** takes off her mask<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Let us speak then.<br>
So, tell me, thespian. Why have you come to my quarters unnanounced?<br>
**Wisp**: Ah, she appologizes. The circus has been getting some renoun in the city and she wished to discus with thee, being that thee are of great report, and the opportunity to expand and help expand the opperations within the city.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: You think your circus can help me?<br>
Wisp: She thinks that the circus is not an ordinary circus and indeed has gotten great renoun in the city and perhaps can do even more for what thy are interested in.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Hmm, so be it. Make your proposal and I shall hear it out.<br>
**Wisp**: Ah, well, any great sales person would know, would need to know a little bit about what you are trying to acomplish and perhaps she can tailor the proposal to what thee would require.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Any good sales person would have already done that research before announcing their proposal unannounced and uninvited.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** unsheathes one of the scabbards and locks eyes.<br>
**Wisp**: She does have such a proposal. But would it not be bennificial to thy business if you would help her understand what would make that buisness even greater?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Perhaps. But you should also know if my reputation preceeds me of what it is my buisness is about; classified and secretive. I would not tell anyone just off the street So, tell me. What is your proposal?<br>
**Wisp**: Well, due to Master Zacharius' recent mission, she thinks that the circus could provide an outward facing and publically available facade for the Inquisition. In addition, there are all types of theives, mages, men & women of questionable origin and alignment who come to the cirucs. Indeed it attracts those sorts of people. She suggests a partnershp. You could acomplish thy mission and you could place people strategically within the circus and staff and in exchange she, we could negitiate a business proposal in exchange for some coin and we would work together for the common purpose of the Inquisition.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: An interesting proposal. But why seek me? Surly the White Council would be more easily available. How did you even know that I was here?<br>
**Wisp**: Thy reputation proceeds you, as you have said, Inquisitor Kalla'Jin. You are well known for everything that you have acomplished and she would want to see you specifically for the background that you have had in such issues.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: A shame that my competence and effectiveness would grant me something that is so inconvenient for my line of work.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** places the weapon on the table and leans against it, a bit more casually<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Very well. Your proposal has some merit to it. It is true that the Inquisition suffers from an image problem. Especially with our current attempt at reformations with Dalton. Orde could certianly use such assistance. Indeed, with the looming threat above us it is unity that we should look forward to. And the people fear the Inquisition perhaps more, well, not more than they should, but for the wrong reasons. Hmm, very well. What resources does your Unwise Six posess? How many tents, troupadores, companies? What is your logistics?<br>
**Wisp**: We are six, presently. We could currently be more. We suggest that bringing some of the Inquisitors on to the staff and having them dress up as stage-hands would give a great eye into all the people that are traveling around and seeing the circus. In addition, depending on how public you would want this to be, it could be very public. It could be a public facing aspect of the Inquistion. Or it could be quite private and you could use it to your own advantage to discover the evils of the city. She would be open to either proposal.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I see. Just six of you? I mean no offence to this, but it seems you are a little to big for your scabbard, yes?<br>
***Kalla'Jin** makes tea with some magic shares a cup with Wisp<br>
**Wisp**: Inquisitor Kalla'Jin, we have gone nowhere as fast as we have without being ambitious. Surely something that you could appreciate with what you have accomplished in that line of work?

(Persuasion check `13(7)`)

> **Arcadum**: It kinda bounces off of her. She notices the attempt and is not ungrateful for it. For she is not someone who gets flattered a lot.<br>
***Wisp** takes a sip of the tea and in an attempt to diffuse the situation<br>
**Wisp**: This is quite lovely. What is it?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: It is a special blend that is made within the Northern Wisted Isles. It is soothing. It dulls pain.<br>
Now then. I suppose that use of circus might have perhaps a some inclination. But what of resources? How much would this cost? Surely if I were to provide Inquisitors for this performance, where would you perform? Have you the permission to perform from the nobility? Or do you intend to do this in taverns?<br>
**Wisp**: We will start in taverns and she would suggest that that is perhaps one of the best places to begin. In taverns we can discover and talk to the true nature of the people and after that the nobles would recognize us by virtue of that popularity. Would you agree?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I would only agree if you were that good (*chuckles*)<br>

(Perception check `10(8)`)

> **Arcadum**: As you look you notice one of her scars does not appear to be battle made and it appears to be glowing slightly.

(Religion check `21(20)`)

> **Arcadum**: Even though you were only able to see a brief image of it, you were able to recoginze the points of the 7-pointed star of The Seven. A glowing scar placed directly upon her body, marking her as a follower or perhaps something more.

> **Kalla'Jin**: Normally, were this just a few years ago I would have scoffed at such an offer, but my recent escapades have taught me to be more understanding of those that make their living amongst the dirt and trill. Especially those that gamble...<br>
So, therefore fine. Let's just assume for a moment that your circus is of appropriate skill and entertainment that it can be spread as widely as you infer. Well, if that is the case, then what is your proposal of changing the vissage of the Inquisition? You would have them dress as actors, yes? But is it not the intention of actors to act as something else? How would they know?<br>
**Wisp**: A very good question, Master Inquistor. Sometimes it is not the direct actions that one goes through but the perception and culture that it creates in order to send a certain type of message. Indeed, if the Inquisition is involved in something cheerful, jovial, positive this would echo into the people and their thoughts would follow. Do you agree?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I agree that such a thing is possible. But the execution of such a thing is not quite as simple as stated. But please continue with your analogy.<br>
**Wisp**: She would agree, it is quite difficult. These are things that change culturally over great periods of time and so it takes many actions. Indeed, the Inquisition of Orde spans many cities, the great world as a whole. And so this is just a small part of it. We can't claim to fix the entire problem, but we can be a start.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I suppose that it is unfair to infer that such a thing would be easily fixed. Yes, perhaps I am a bit harsh in my...<br>
In either case, so be it. Let us say that what you say is true. What is your plan? How many Inquisitors would you require? Where do you intend to start?<br>
**Wisp**: We shall start small. Let's have a beginning show, see how it goes, for a reasonable price.<br>
And so we would start small, we would see the impact, and then we would meet again and we would analyze the results and proceed forward.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** will take a deep drink from her tea as if mulling over the proposal<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Well you're certainly an entertainer. And I must admit... I am not. There are those, I suppose, whose skill sets may be useful to the Inquisition. I suppose I should do what I can. Hmm, perhaps I could send a letter of proposal. It would take some time for me to hear back. But, yes, perhaps... perhaps this could be a good idea, yes. In fact, in the past Inquisitors that even employe-<br>
***Kalla'Jin** stops all of a sudden and stares directly at Wisp

> **Arcadum**: You feel a dangerous aura eminating from her. Do you do anything?<br>
**Devin (Wisp)**: No. Definitely not.<br>
**Arcadum**: And then she will suddenly move hand up in front of her face and catch something. She will move her hand foward and in a single rotation you will hear the snapping of bone. She will crash her glass across the desk and will shove the shard under the mask of the would-be assassin.

> **Kalla'Jin**: It would seem that our meeting has been interrupted.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** tosses the assassin on the ground.<br>
**Wisp**: Do-does that happen quite often during thy business meetings? (*terrified*)<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: No. It does not.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** pulls back the mask of the assassin and holds it up.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: As I suspected. It seems they seek to silence me. Please remain seated. Your filled-mouth demeanor depicts me you are not one here to kill me. However, your presence whilst this individual attacks me is most... inconvenient for you.<br>
I am going to infer my magics upon you now. Do not resist, if you have nothing to hide.<br>
**Wisp**: She has told you the truth to the best of her ability.<br>
***Wisp** stays seated.

> **Arcadum**: Kalla'Jin will place her hand upon your head and will summon forth one of her many blessed, divine gifts. You will feel your recent memories bubble to the front. And then she will stop.<br>
Alright, decent chance, you did well. But now it's up to the die.

([d100] ==> `56` -- Good result, above 50)

> **Arcadum**: As she begins to scan through your memories she will stop as the image of Zacharius appears. Specifically your conversation with him. She will step back.

> **Kalla'Jin**: (*chuckles*) How serendipitous this world can truly be. You did not say that you were allied with Zacharius. Tell me. What is he up to?<br>
**Wisp**: Ah, well, we met him in a forest some time ago. He was traveling. He came to tell us the story of The Seven.<br>
***Wisp** subtlely nods towards the glowing seven-pointed star on Kalla'Jin's body<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Strange this world can be with its crossings of storied weaves, I suppose. So you have met Zacharius? Intersting indeed. Tell me. What is it that you know of our fight?<br>
**Wisp**: She knows a great evil looms in the sky. She has learned of it quite recently. She knows that souls in this world are more complicated, but perhaps she herself has no such soul. Or she believes the word Master Zacharius refered to was Refraction. Though, some of the Unwise Six do have these. They echo through eternity in a way that she does not fully understand.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: There are refracted souls amongst your order!?<br>
**Wisp**: As she understands it to be, but she must confess, Master Inquisitor, that she knows very little about this.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Take me to them.<br>
**Wisp**: Presently?

(Group has a bit of a stress relieving reaction to the situation so far)

> ***Kalla'Jin** she will gather her weapons<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Take me to them.<br>
**Wisp**: Of course.

---

The party meets with Kalla'Jin out on the docks:

> **Wisp**: Ah, the Unwise Six. This is the infamous Inquisitor, Kalla'Jin. And we have successfully discussed our first buisness proposal where we shall be running a circus in order to help the public face of the Inquisition.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** looks at Angorn<br>
**Vim**: Why is she staring at Angorn?<br>
**Wisp**: Ah, she does that. That's kinda her thing.<br>
**Flamewrath**: Would you like an autograph?<br>
**Wisp**: We have fliers, too! Show her a flier.<br>
**Nidhogg**: (garbled between others speaking)...making a friend?!<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Greetings and salutations, thespians.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I am no thespian, I am a guard.<br>
**Raber**: Orc.
**Angorn**: What is the meaning of this?!<br>
**Wisp**: We have established a buisness arangement.<br>
***Wisp** takes a flier from Flamewrath and shows it to Kalla'Jin<br>
**Wisp**: This is our marketing department over there. His name is Flamewrath. Isn't it lovely?<br>
**Flamewrath**: (*awkwardly*) ...yes.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** looks at the flier and back up at the party.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Tell me, Astarothian, what brings you to Fireport?<br>
**Angorn**: Oh, you know. A little bit of this and a little bit of that.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: So, this one has informed me of manythings. Circus, what you could do with, and then she told me one of you, or more than one of you possess Refracted souls. Is this true?<br>
**Vim**: Oh, this shit again...<br>
**Angorn**: Oh! Well, I mean, yes, by accident I suppose that could be true.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I don't even know what those are. There's just a bunch of people that are me, apparently.<br>
**Angorn**: The wimpy fellow explained it to us.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I know! It still doesn't make sense!<br>
**Angorn**: Yes. I must agree. Are you here to inform us the precise nature of having a refracted soul? How it happens perhaps?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: There is a limit to the knowledge that I posess, specifically. I do not know how one's soul becomes refracted, only that it is so. And it would seem that you and you posses them. But you also know a friend. Zacharius is a questionable lad in some regards dealing with powers that I don't approve of. But then again I also do things that many do not approve of and I suppose that *if* you have made ally with him, then that means perhaps your movements could be trusted.<br>
**Nidhogg**: He likes me the most.<br>
**Angorn**: Listen lady. I believe I have heard passing mention of your name. The words you're speaking now, uhhh, hint heavily that perhaps your loyalties are beginning to become skewed. Surely you could beat us to death and extract the information you're after. However, as a goodly woman who serves a greater purpose in this glorious White country, could you give us your word perhaps that you're not going to simply turn us into the Inquisition and have us all flayed?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Oh, my dear dwarf, if I was to do that I would do it myself! (*chuckles*)<br>
***Party** laughs along<br>
**Nidhogg**: What the hell is going on!?<br>
***Wisp** nudges Nidhogg<br>
**Wisp**: Stop laughing.<br>
**Nidhogg**: NO!<br>
**Angorn**: What I mean to say is, uhh, it seems we have a common enemy. I just need some confirmation that we may become allies.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: You spoke of loyalty. My loyalty is to Kalkatesh. Sometimes that means Orde will look unfavorably upon my actions. But before I reveal anything more where, Astarothian, do your loyalties lie?<br>
**Nidhogg**: Who cares if people look down on your actions?!<br>
***Kalla'Jin** ignores Nidhogg and stares at Angorn<br>
**Angorn**: I serve the Black Sun and of course I aim to carry out our ultimate mission to obliterate the enemy in the sky. Our common enemy, that which has become apparent and informed to me by my Lord himself after consultation in deep prayer.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: And just like the times past it would seem that the Light and the Dark must rise as one. So be it. Your god lays(?) you in order to set you upon this enemy. But, I cannot help but wonder, what exactly is it you intend to do about The Enemy? If I were to be informed of your movements I perhaps I could ensure that my own do not tarry or interfere. Perhaps there is synergy in this knowledge. Would not agree that combined our strengths are greater?<br>
**Angorn**: Good lady, perhaps we can speak elsewhere and perhaps we have some information that may be useful to you?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Some place quiet of course!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Perhaps you could meet Zacharius again if you want?<br>
**Wisp**: She has a lovely office, however, it might be a little dirty right now.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: That will be a fine place. Come. Follow me.<br>
And Bennex...<br>
**Bennex**: Uhh... yes m'lady?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I seem to recall that you have yet to pay back that recompense to that couple whose chickens you stole. Yes?<br>
**Bennex**: Uhh, well, you know, I umm, am still getting the money.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: There are greater things of my concern at this time, but if come back out here and I do not see you with that money I will drown you.<br>
Do you understand me?<br>
**Bennex**: Yes, m'lady!<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: And then I will revive you and drown you another time. And then when you are revived a second time I will allow you to attempt to pay it back again.<br>
**Bennex**: Yes, m'lady! It will be paid immediately!<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: This is good! Very good.<br>
Fuck off now...

---

The party heads back to Kalla'Jin's office to discuss more privately:

> **Angorn**: Listen lady, I'll be frank. We learned from your friend Zach that there is a magistrate funneling information, money, or fund, or all of the above to an order knowns as the The Order of the Shattered Star and he has tasked us to find out the truth of the matter and perhaps even eliminate this man if need be.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Interesting. And whom is this man?<br>
**Angorn**: A magistrate within Crestfall. I believe his name as Ladlum? Laudlum perhaps?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: You are referring to one of the White Council and that your intention is to... kill... them?<br>
**Angorn**: What? This fellow belongs to the White Counil, does he? Let me just say, good lady, we are not positive that is the outcome that need arise from our encounter with this fellow. Merely that you must expose the truth of his involvement with this Order that seeks to further the enemy's goals.<br>
**Vim**: He's embezzling funds. Kind of a useless bitch.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Yes, it would seem that this evidence coincides with my own. There is another group, members of an Ember Order that seek to root out this corruption. However, my avenues are now limited since...<br>
***Kalla'Jin** takes a long moment to consider revealing<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Since my excommunication.<br>
**Angorn**: Oh, girl. I am sorry. It's not easy, I suppose, in a place like this where such a thing... were it not for your reputation you would be done.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Indeed, it would seem that my privliges still yet linger. But hence why I have sought other avenues to seek this evidence. But it seems that fortune's fate and the Matron has smiled upon us all. Because if you are already tasked by your lord Astaroth to seek this Council and you have already been provided evidence and, no doubt, by an old confidant of mine then it would seem that I am not out of cause to play.<br>
Now, make no mistake. To attempt to kill one of the White Council is very difficult. Not only in the actual execution but survival afterwards. For I know not much about your religion, but I know that Astaroth does not breed martyrs. So, I assume that you would like to live after you have completed your mission.<br>
**Raber**: Ye.<br>
**Angorn**: I must confess it is serendipitious that it is our goal to do as such with the White Counci because I, myself, for my own personal religious order was actually unleashed into this realm proper to punnish the dwarves of Krazax for leaving the true path.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I cannot speak to the ancient grudges of your kin, only to the White Council. So, there we have it. I seek the will and the moral to see that this White Council is punnished, but I lack the tools to do so. And then as is with the Matron's fickle fortunes I am granted the tools to do so. So, this is what I shall say. Work with me, we will bring the White Council to its knees. We shall root out this corruption and we will see that the Council is made anew with those of righteous minds and pure hearts. Do this and perhaps I could overlook the inevitible moral quandaries you will place yourself within. And who knows? perhaps I can be reinstated.<br>
**Vim**: You want us to kill all of them?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: What!? No! Of course not. Not all of them are corrupted, only some. But the problem is finding which ones. As much as I do not like it to be so the White Council and the bureaucratic acrination(sp?) of the White Pantheon is quite convoluted. Were I an Inquisitor I could cut paths to many  of this convolution, but alas I have lost such status. So, perhaps those of a darker trim could do this in my stead. I could provide support on your mission and once it is completed then the White Council can be healed.<br>
**Angorn**: Good lady, I do not mean insult you. It stands to reason you have very little left to lose beyond your reputation. Is this the reason you do not, yourself, investigate this magistrate and kill the fellow who is currently working for the Order of the Shattered Star, purportedly?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: My evidence needs to be paramount for my blade to strike. I cannot kill those that I simply am suspicious of without proper evidence, especially one as annointed as the magistrate Laurel. Now could I do it? Yes, but I would forever remain outcast from my order. And my order, without my help, will falter. The guidance of Zacharius has faded and Inquisitor Rok(?) is pressed in from all side. There are those that even whisper with in the Council to close the Order, to seek the Inquisition's dissolution. Undoing the hard work of Zacharius and Inquisitor Rok(?). I cannot allow this to happen, but I cannot do anything about this if I am labled a criminal. Excommunication is bad enough, but I were to kill this man? I am afraid that I would never again walk in the light. We all have our faiths and our paths, dwarf. I'm sure you can understand.<br>
**Angorn**: Indeed.<br>
**Vim**: We'll kill him. Easily.<br>
**Angorn**: Listen, lady, is it truly even worth it to live in a place like this if you must run this facade for your superiors under the guise that they are living righteously whiel you do their dirty work and shovel their shit out of their stables? What do they believe and think of you? Why do you continue doing this?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Because it is my home. I'm sure a dwarf could understand the significance of that.<br>
**Angorn**: Indeed.<br>
**Wisp**: It seems we have every reason to work with her, do we not?<br>
**Flamewrath**: Just get a new home.<br>
**Wisp**: Just build a new house?<br>
**Flamewrath**: I was removed from my home and now I'm here.<br>
**Vim**: And you cry about it every day.<br>
**Flamewrath**: Silence! Also, I spaced out for most of the conversation. Are we still a circus? Are we still going to perform?<br>
**Angorn**: Speaking of which, yes. I have no qualms with assisting you with your mission, but only because it aligns with ours.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Of course. I would *hate* to infer or interfere with the actions of Astaroth<br>
(she definitely would).<br>
Then we have an accord, do we not?<br>
**Party**: Yes.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Can we hurry up and do something? Sitting around is never ...<br>
**Angorn**: We have just established a very powerful ally within the internal government of Orde. Is that not doing something?<br>
**Nidhogg**: No! It's talking and...<br>
**Wisp**: That means he says, "yes".<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: So be it.<br>
**Wisp**: Master Inquisitor?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Yes?<br>
**Wisp**: We seek a, we have heard of a certain symbol. It is a thing wreathed in flame that supposedly represents the corruption we have been talking of. Would thee know of where to find such a thing?<br>
**Nidhogg**: It was a symbol of The Seven wreathed in flame.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Yes, you are referring to this. A recent correspondence that I have had with the Ember Order. Curious, but do not think I like their new symbology. I for one preferred the Orange Star.<br>
But I cannot help but wonder, what is it exactly that you require it for?<br>
**Wisp**: She does not know. She was told that it was a symbol that would help us understand the corruption as we have been speaking of.<br>
**Angorn**: To prove it perhaps. But also perhaps we were meant to show it to you?

(Persuasion checks: Angorn - `19` & Wisp - `13(7)`)

> **Kalla'Jin**: There is enough serendipity that perhaps such a statement is not entirely impossible. But why do you seek this document? Is it for someone else? Were you told by a vision?<br>
**Angorn**: Our initial plan was to retrieve that symbol and head to Crestfall and to use that to expose the Magistrate. I'm not sure how, where, or who even we would have shown it to. Merely that that is what Zach told us to retrieve.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Then it would seem that serendipity it is, because this evidence is the bit that I have that leads to me to the magistrate suspicions. So be it, it would seem that things are going more swimmingly than I'd originally expected.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** hands the letter to Angorn.<br>
**Angorn**: Who's the dead guy? What happened in here?<br>
**Wisp**: Yea, that was really weird.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Who cares?! It's just a dead body.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: This was an assassin, no doubt sent by the Order of the Shattered Star to silence me. Hence further confirming my suspicion that such one of their Order has infultrated the White Council and corrupted them. I find it to be most convenient that I was excommunicated, removed of my chaperones, and somewhat some of my strength, then an assassin suddenly appears in an unused room in a popular trading company house where an old friend of mine would keep my identity and purpose here hidden.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What even is the Shattered Star?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: The Shattered Star, now that is the question of what exactly it is. I suspect that it is an Order ran or perhaps puppeteerd by a Servant of The Enemy. Using these non-corruped servant to move unseen by one such as us.<br>
**Flamewrath**: So what do we do?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Well now you take this letter and continue your mission.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Does this mean we can leave now?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Yes, it does.<br>
**Angorn**: Any advice for, I don't know, behaving within Crestfall? Any people or allies that may be favorable to you that we could name-drop you for?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: No doubt that my reputation would get you far, but this is a mission of subtlety and my name, unfortunately, carries impact.<br>
**Flamewrath**: Not as much as the Unwise Six, though.<br>
**Wisp**: Well, we could use both to the advantage. Since we have established a business relationship if it is necessary-<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: I would prefer that you not use my name until I have met you in Crestfall. I shall be there at some point in the next week or so. I have some loose ends to tie up here.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** looks to the corpse on the floor<br>
**Wisp**: If we were to start a circus somewhere woudl it not be advantageous to use thy name? In order to get in some place?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Sure.<br>
**Wisp**: Very good.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: Now I wish to keep tabs upon you and to offer you what protections I might.<br>
***Kalla'Jin** pulls one of her remaining swords and offers it forward<br>
***Vim** steps forward<br>
**Vim**: That's a nice sword. Check mine out.<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: A fine blade, but this one you may use to keep you safe. And also it will mark you as an agent of mine.<br>
**Vim**: A what?<br>
**Kalla'Jin**: An agent of mine.<br>
**Vim**: What does that mean?<br>
**Wisp**: It means that we can get into places, use the circus, it is very useful. Take it.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Vim as an agent of an Inquisitor?! Ha ha!<br>
**Flamewrath**: Vim, it seems you are the agent of a lot of things.<br>
**Vim**: Silence! Hand it over.<br>
**Arcadum**: And she will hand you her blade known as Forbearance.

The party makes pleasantries with Kalla'Jin and departs.

(Arcadum keeps his word and due to Devin's work with Kalla'Jin the party gains a level -- level 4)
