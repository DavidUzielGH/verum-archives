# Tearing Veil -- Session 06

Aired: 11/06/2020

Session picks up where session 05 left off with Zach giving a proper introduction to the group and his purpose for coming before them.

## Relevant Lore

### The Gang Learns About Violet

Zach and the party discuss what occurred and he does his best to explain to them about The Enemy, The Herald, The Violet and the dangers of all of it.

Angorn, doubting that any of what Zach is telling them can possibly be true (for how could there be an enemy stronger than a god?), prays to his god Astaroth.

Astaroth answers Angorn's pray saying that Zach is correct, and the Enemy needs to be crushed.

Zach informs the party of the source of the corruption in the White Council revealing that the Magistrate is funneling money into the Order of the Shattered Star. He continues on by instructing the party to not murder him, but verify what he's doing and gather more information.

The relevant information Zach is able to provide entails:
* Talakar Tuskbreaker is a dockworker that should have information on the strange things happening in Crestfall.
* Laudlum is the alias of the corrupt Magistrate.

### The Violet Eye & The Changeling

Flamewrath, continuing to try and figure out what his ability to control Raber's flaming blood means and what he can do to further these abilities, asks Zach if he knows anything about it.

Arcadum informs Dodger that Zach is able to see some sort of presence, a shadow, lingering behind Flamewrath. But that he'd need to look *deeper* to learn more.

Zach decides look at Flamewrath with his Violet Eye.

> **Arcadum**: You will see that there is what appears to be a shadow of blood walking just behind wherever Flamewrath goes.<br>
However I have something else to tell you.<br>
Your eye begins to reflect off of his skin, and it is too late before you realize what he is.
>
> Your eye begins to look over Flamewrath, and you do not realize it before it is too late. Flamewrath is not a human but he is a changeling and as such your eye begins to reflect off of his skin. You see a frightened pale skinned woman and behind her reveals your eye
>
> The Violet reflects off of this mirror, and thus I need you to make a Wisdom saving throw, let's see if you can stop yourself.

(10(7) + 7 = 17)

> **Arcadum**: With a 17 you are able to pull back your face, almost covering your eye, but in that brief instance in the flash of a mere second, you see many different flashing images.<br>
Listen carefully.
>
> Seven Points, a center spiral, a rising sun, a falling star, and 12 points of Violet light, like needles pierce the tapestry of Kalkatesh, and one by one the lights bloom into radiant flowers and from that point the Herald appears.
>
> Okay, as you can see I have a very important thing for everyone here to discuss. Now many of you are not fully connected to the story.

Party is given the option to spend Order as a result of Dodger making the Wisdom save from looking through Flamewrath.

> **Arcadum**: You can:<br>
1. Strengthen the resolve of the people of Crestfall to help resist the corruption of the White Council.<br>
2. Use it to infuse the graves of the nearby dragons in this area. Reviving those that were lost.<br>
3. Release a visage of light upon this world. Within this realm, not too far away it is revealed within your Violet sight that there is a place of power that can be used against the Enemy. It is a buried light, one that was sealed away by Orde many years ago, because it was feared to be too reckless to be used, and it was forgotten, all knowledge of it expunged by the Inquisition in the 2nd era.

Each one will cost 2 Order, current Order is 14.<br>
Group chooses to spend Order on everything. 6 Order is used, 8 Order remains. (How could Dodger do this? PepeHands)

> **Arcadum**: Zach you know that Flamewrath is a Changeling, use that as you will.
>
> Soda I get to explain to you what the hell happened.<br>
You are a Changeling, an all female race that can change what you look like. But, there is a secret of the changeling race and that is since you can become anyone you become a reflection of that person. And because you can become a reflection of that person your very body is a living mirror. That's why your patron god Tomen is a god of reflections. And that's a deity that has yet to be fully released. The intent here is that whenever a Violet Eye looks through a mirror it views things through the mirrored realm. Which means it can be viewed across anywhere that there is a mirror. Because all mirrors go to the same realm, including you. Whenever an Eye looks through the mirrored realm it can see and be seen by anything and specifically because all Violet power is shared by the Enemy, the Enemy can see you wherever the mirror is.
>
> There is also a boon, because Zach made the save, he was able to keep his sight controlled, and just as the Enemy can see through the violet eye, so can those that wield the violet eye see through the Enemy. So Zach was given a prescient look into the Enemy's plans.

### Shopping in Town

The group has a big shopping session. They purchase a bunch of potions as well as obtain some experimental, magical item that sometimes all-the-time lets one breathe even when there is nothing breathable. They also barter with the potion seller to take his "air extractor" and put it somewhere nicer that is less polluted in exchange for free potions.

Vim tries to find a blacksmith to hammer down the breast cups of the female Nightguard armor he stole off the boss from the previous session. The smith gives him a lot of guff about it and asks for 500GP. Vim finds this ridiculous to which the smith hints he knows Vim is no Nightguard but won't reveal it.<br>
Angorn, claiming his ancestors skills must somehow flow through him, asks if he can borrow the smith's anvil and do it himself.

(Smithing tool check (17?))

The work is passable, and the extra metal now forms some huge shoulder pads. Vim, having none of being the butt of all the jokes eventually settles on a simple set of scale mail.


Wisp finall gets a new purse to replace the one Vim destroyed during their escape from Fireport. Confused as to why Wisp wants the bag, Raber inquires. The group eggs him on into believing it's a status thing and demands to have better clothes for himself. He gets a total makeover and is now (jokingly) known as _\_\_.

Nidhogg heads off to a flower shop to purchase some of his wife's favorite flowers as it happens to be near (the day of?) her death. Nidhogg finally shares with the party this fact of his backstory and there's a brief bonding.

During the course of the flower shop browsing Arcadum reveals that Violets, the flower, do not exist in Verum.
