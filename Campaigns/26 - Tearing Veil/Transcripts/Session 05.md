### Vim Eats A Heart

> **Skittering Speaker**: Servant... Your feasting is paramount, we eat on the hallowed ground of Orde. This pleases the hunger.<br>
**Vim**: Yes.<br>
**Skittering Speaker**: We sense corruption. The feast begins. Take thy reward.<br>
***Skittering Speaker** bites Vim and crawls into his skin<br>
**Arcadum**: You may not be quite the pretty boy anymore. The good news is phenomenal cosmic power.
>
> You are granted a new ability: You are granted the Skittering Tide. Once per long rest you may transform into a swarm of spiders. This form lasts for one minute.
Swarm form.
Automatic damage to any creature who takes up your four squares, you can move in and out of small places. Damage is [3d6] poison.

### Nightguard Kyson's Note

Standing orders dictate that Kyson was sent to train the paladins by order of the Nightlord himself. It seems that the Nightlord’s specific orders were to learn to work with the brothers in the light if they are to hope to stand against the Enemy in the sky.

**Wand of the Silver Sting**: 25 charges, recharge 3 charges per long rest. each of these magic missiles fires [1d4+5], 3 each.

### Long-rest in Gambler Black's New "Temple"

Vim and Flamewrath take second watch. Arcadum rolls a 96 on a [d100], and a strange person appears (token names it as "???").

> **Arcadum**: The individual is wrapped in shadow, and with red hair, which seems to be freshly dyed, as it drips down in front of it.

> **Arcadum**: As you call out, it will raise its hand in greeting.

> **Flamewrath**: Hello, what the fuck do you want?<br>
**???**: Greetings, watchmen. I am but a traveler, I was wondering if I might ask you a few questions? I seem to be lost.<br>
**Flamewrath**: Want a cigarette?<br>
**???**: I could partake if you have to spare<br>
***???** will take a cigarette and light it with a flame

(However, this flame takes on a different color than the orange fire, the flame is Violet)

> **Flamewrath**: How is your fire so cool looking?<br>
**???:** ‘Tis a blessing, simple as that.<br>
**???:** Such kindness should be rewarded in kind.<br>
**Flamewrath**: I like smoking, and I like people who smoke, and that color was cool, I like that.<br>
**Vim**: It was a cool color.<br>
**???:** Oh, thank you.I think you two are two of the coolest gentlemen.<br>
**???:** I do not wish to take up more of your time, so I will be brief. I was wondering, do you happen to know how I may get to Fireport?<br>
**Flamewrath**: Yes we just came from Fireport, in fact, when you get there-
Vim: Wait.<br>
Vim: what business do you have in fireport, if I may ask?<br>
**???:** Oh a little pleasure, a little business. Mostly, I am seeking new waters. Orde has fallen into disarray you see, the White Council is just not what I thought it would be.<br>
**Flamewrath**: Tell us about the White Council, and we’ll tell you how to get to Fireport.<br>
**???:** Of course, I don't mind sharing my story. You see, I was an acolyte to Runetheras, pretty stable in my income. I liked what I did, I showed knowledge where there was ignorance. There are so many things in this world that people just do not know, but I believe that if they did know, their lives would be so much easier. Especially when it comes to the Seven.<br>
**Flamewrath**: The fuck are the Seven? Is that our competition?<br>
**???**: The Seven are a… Do you not know the Seven?<br>
**Vim**: Yes, we know the Seven. I’ll just say he’s not smoking nicotine.
>
> **???**: In either case, yes. I have come from the White Council, I actually tried to ascend myself there, but I was turned down. Apparently, one's merits are not what was chosen there, but rather the wealth that one has. A disappointing revelation for one who believes in hard work such as I. I tried to live with it but I couldn’t, I could not see how a council of all the best that the world has to offer required payment to get in.<br>
**Vim**: Yes, it is truly disgusting. Merit should be all that the White Council takes.<br>
**???**: Truth be told, I was most disappointed in the Seven. They are the mortal heroes after all, the ones that represent Hope and fairness and all of that, but when I went to their temple and asked for ascension I was snuffed and dismissed. I thought it so strange, so I had continued my research, and the things I learned about the White Council and the Seven disturbed me, and so I leave for Fireport in the hopes that I might find passage to another place.<br>
**Flamewrath**: What specifically did you learn that made you just leave all out?<br>
**???**: It is an unsettling fact, but what I had learned about the Seven was.

(The stranger will start speaking in the Violet language)

> **Arcadum**: The two of you begin to float off the ground, have your voices stolen, and feel your bodies crash into themselves. I have some music for you to play.

(Violet theme begins to play)

> **Arcadum**: Angorn and Nidhogg, I speak to Jesse and Lane. Roll me a d20, plus every character that you have played.

Surefour rolls a [d20+7 => 11]<br>
Moon rolls a [d20+6 => 19]

> **Arcadum**: Nidhogg continues to sleep. Angorn, however, will have a strange dream.
>
> Angorn, you dream of tyranny and dominance, but then you see something interrupt your wonderful dream. There is a flash of Violet light, a wrongness washes over you, as you turn you see, (which refraction do you want to see?)

> **Moon (Angorn/Scrumpo)**: It's Scrumpo time, boys!

> **Arcadum**: You see a small Gnomish creature walk up to wearing a fundoshi and nothing else, he'll begin to gyrate his hips in a strange manner.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I got something to tell you, listen to me.<br>
**Angorn**: What?<br>
**Scrumpo**: You need to wake up now, you need to wake up.<br>
***Angorn** wakes up.<br>
***Angorn** sits up and looks around.<br>
**Arcadum**: You feel a headache, but then you also feel a strange pull, a whisper of danger. And the fist of Astaroth begins to glow brightly.<br>
***Angorn** punches Nidhogg.<br>
**Angorn**: Wake up boy we're in trouble, get the Orc.<br>
**Angorn** wakes up Wisp, "Get up girl, let's go!"

> **Arcadum**: You see Vim and Flame floating off of the ground. Their faces contorted, their bodies twisted.

> **???**: As I suspected, there were refracted.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What, who are you?<br>
**???**: Would you like me to release them?<br>
**Nidhogg**: I don't know, depends.<br>
**???**: Such unabashed, such uncaring for your comrades.<br>
**Angorn**: Release them masked man.<br>
**???**: And who speaks to me?<br>

(Angorn introduces himself)

> **???**: No. You are more than that.<br>
**Arcadum**: With a snap of its fingers, souls refract into the waking realm. Flashes of all those that came before. Confusion enters your mind, strange feelings, feelings of honor, loyalty, goodness, but equal amounts of greed, sexual confusion, and other such things begin to wash over you from all sides. And then the vision will fade, you’re not even sure if it was real.

> ***Wisp** will take a step forward, and for the briefest moment it will appear as if black wings are behind her, then she’ll look at him and say.<br>
**Wisp**: You shall release our comrades now.<br>
***Wisp** casts Suggestion.<br>
**Arcadum**: The eyes of the creature will flash. The very essence of your magic, as it strikes out towards him, will become contorted, and burn away in Violet flame.

> **Surefour**: Did I see all the souls and stuff go around Angorn?
Arcadum: Yeah.

> **Nidhogg**: What did you do to him? What was that?<br>
**???**: This.<br>
**Arcadum**: The same thing happens to you Nidhogg. You see all around you the different spirits that came before. You see equal amounts of confusion, and then one of an absolute opposite, as a golden Dragonborn stares you down “DEEEEMON!”, and the spirits fade.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What are you doing to us, what is this illusion?<br>
**???**: It is no illusion my friends, it is the truth, and I have been sent with a message. The path that you walk is a foolhardy one. Stray from it, seek a different path. Perhaps, follow the Violet light.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What do you mean follow the Violet light, what is this straying path?<br>
**???**: I can see you, Nidhogg, all of your pain.<br>
***Arcadum** snaps<br>
**Arcadum**: Flashes of the memories of your wife.<br>
**???**: All of your sorrow. The regrets that you once had.<br>
**???**: I can see your hate. The hate against the gods. Tell me, do you wish to destroy them?<br>
**Nidhogg**: Yes, and all their wretchedness.<br>
**???**: Good, I can show you the way.<br>
**Nidhogg**: And how will you show me?

> **Arcadum**: The man will simply offer a hand wreathed in Violet flame.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What happens when I take this hand?<br>
**???**: You will have the strength to destroy the Gods.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Then give me what I truly seek, not a hand, but a soul.<br>
**???**: So be it.<br>
**Arcadum**: A soul will be conjured instead.

> ***Raber** puts his hand on Nidhogg's shoulder, trying to prevent him from interacting with this guy further.<br>
***Nidhogg** will shrug it off, and look at the soul.

> **Surefour (Nidhogg)**: What does it look like?<br>
**Arcadum**: Vengeance. You see the smiling face of your wife, you see the sneering face of the priest. Your heart quickens, your rage burns.

> ***Nidhogg** will try and consume it.

As soon as he does that, Angorn will try and throw his weapon at the guy. The weapon will stop inches from the creature, and will be blown back.

> **Arcadum**: As you grasp the soul, you see several spirits holding your hand back.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Who are all these?<br>
**Arcadum**: They hold your hand back, but you are the one that is active. You are the vessel, your soul pushes forward, but piece by piece you hear them speak:<br>
“Do not give in to the power of demons, DEMON!”<br>
“That's not a skeleton, I wouldn't do it, don't trust skeletons.”<br>
“Aw man I don't know about this, we should just go sailing.”

> **Rob (Raber)**: Can I attempt to interrupt this by attempting to smash?<br>
**Arcadum**: As you move forward, you will suddenly realize you're not alone.<br>
Raber, something stands next to you.

> **Raber**: Huh?<br>
**Arcadum**: A spirit of a minotaur stands next to you, he nods to you, and you are suddenly filled with understanding. This<br>
***Arcadum** points to `???`<br>
**Arcadum**: is the bigger beast, and this<br>
***Arcadum** points to Nidhogg<br>
**Arcadum**: is the meat. You have to stop it.<br>
***Raber** attempts to smash.<br>
**Arcadum**: You swing down with all of your strength, and your weapon does not connect, stopping inches from the creature and is blown backwards.<br>
***Raber** attempts to tackle Nidhogg out of the way<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, Nidhogg. The creature offers you a terrible trade, everything you want. Would you like to resist, or do you give in to its offer?
**Arcadum**: I know you (Surefour) know what it means if you accept.

> **Surefour**: But I have to think of it from Nidhogg's perspective!

> **Nidhogg**: Explain these voices, they keep talking, tell me!<br>
**Arcadum**: You are delayed, you are tackled to the ground by Raber
***Wisp** will use the wand to attack `???`<br>
**Arcadum**: Magic missiles go flying towards the creature, towards its hands. The creature will turn, and raise its other hand, destroying the missiles in the middle of their flying, however, this will distract it long enough.<br>
Flame and Vim you are both freed from your strange stasis.<br>
**Wisp**: Stop this creature! There's no time, stop him!<br>
**???:** It would seem that my message has been turned down. Very well.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I did not turn it down, come back here!<br>
**???:** So be it. Evil is always the easiest to corrupt.<br>
**Arcadum**: And the creature vanishes.

---

Party will banter and talk about what the hell just happened.

> **Vigors (Vim)**: what did we feel when we were being fucking stasis’d?<br>
**Arcadum**: You feel as if you are nothing. It’s worse than death, you almost forgot yourself.

> **Devin (Wisp)**: Is there anything I can do as a Lore Bard, like a story or something?<br>
**Arcadum**: As you attempt to try and remember if there are any stories, you will suddenly feel the presence of the Gambler Black. Not coming from the temple, but coming from the South, as a stranger darkens the road.

### Zach Arrives

More party banter as Arcadum gets everything set up, and Dodger loads in.

> **Arcadum**: And approaching the road, you will feel the presence of the Gambler Black, Nidhogg. Slowly, the shadows begin to part, as you see this.<br>
The shadows part, as you see a finely dressed man, with simple black glasses, and a cane approach you.

(Arcadum introduces Zach)

> **Arcadum**: You have heard the tale of corruption of the White Council, and along the way you are granted a vision by the Gambler Black, a brother in arms, and that a grand temple has been taken, and so, you were sent to deal with it. However, your pulse was quickened as you sensed the Violet, your eye flashing, granting you foresight. You rushed to the aid of these individuals, but moments before you arrived, the creature was gone, and the scene begins.

The party banters, and Zach tries to get a grasp of what’s going on. He walks into the temple and the Gambler will appear and say:
> **Gambler Black**: It's good to see you made it boy, just in time, too. The Enemy is moving, and these nimrods need your council. I'll leave it to you and your soft words, for now this will be a place of sanctuary. no fightin' now.

The party banters more, Nidhogg rips off a bench and throws it at Angorn with advantage. The group steps outside and everyone smokes a cigarette. Angorn throws shade on Nidhogg for being in denial about worshipping a god. Party also explains they killed a Night Guard and some paladins.

Zach and party will begin talking about the Violet being they just interacted with, what refraction is, and what this all means.


> **Arcadum**: The veil begins to tear even further, as Oloken'hai's secret plan begins to unfurl.

End of Session.
