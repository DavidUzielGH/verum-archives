# Gambler's Delight -- Session 04

## Relevant Lore

Continuing from where the party left off last time, having just freed the last known Cyclops, Xetor, from his Amber prison the party strikes up a conversation. Eventually:
> **Xetor**: You're referring to the test of reflection, yes?<br>
Please understand that you are at the precipice. You stand at the edge of history, the last thread hangs in but a precarious balance. Please, hear my words and consider my tale before you decide.

Raost decides to sneak a peek of what Xetor looks like in his mirror fragment:
> **Arcadum**: As you look at the mirror you see if you can catch his reflection, you see that the mirror version is different from what you see.<br>
The creature that you see before you in the mirror is a being that appears to be phantasmal, spiritual, you can see the same outline of a cyclops. But instead of it being an old man it is infact a fiery spirit, forever young, and ephemeral in its form. The spirit looks at you, and smiles and gives a brief nod, almost as if whatever part of the the cyclops this mirror represents is aware in some way.

Continuing on with the party's conversation:
> **Xetor**: I am Xetor. A simple name, but it is mine. And I was the lore keeper of Ang'galosh. How to describe and where to begin? My people see things simultaneously. Most live in a singular line, so the beginning of things is very difficult to understand to those who lack the sight. For my eye sees what is, what is to be, and what has been all at the same time. I suppose I shall start before the start. Before time, I suppose, was written on slated stone. Before the seed was planted.
>
> Long ago, beyond even my time, my forefathers, the first of Kalkatesh, they shared this world with all manner of strange beings. They shared it with Linnorms. They shared it with the Gazeran(sp?). They shared it with the spirits, whose elements drifted between the waking and dreaming realm. We lived a life of peace. Prosperity. We lived a life of knowing. We built many things, great and terrible some, but most of all magnificent. We discovered the power of mirrors and in this discovery we found a truth. That our world is refracted in its many pieces and that the confines of time are only based on one's view. We sought to improve our sight and through them we saw so many things.
>
> There was one that our elders foresaw, an end of all things. The destruction the likes of which could never be recovered from. In our attempt to protect ourselves we used this power to take them. To take the people not yet born. To take a culture not yet found. We took them and brought them to the past. Their reflections became themselves. They were our children in a way. It was our hope that they would live and not die as they were doomed to do so. And yet, we were wrong. For though we were able to bring them here, the calamity followed them. It is formless. It is nameless. It is... powerful. Within an existence different from our own. All things cling to life, but it did not. Its destruction was beautiful, in a way. And so my people, fearing the worst, used the only power we could find. We used the strength of the earth, of the trees. We called upon nature to protect us, and through fire and life, of stone and earth, we bound ourselves, as the day would come.
>
> But we were all of us deceived, for it knew. It knew what we had intended to do. It hardened the seals and our salvation became our prison. It stole the power we had left behind and it prepared. Each calamity that has befallen our home has been the undulations of this creature's actions. The day came when it reached fruition, its power undeniable. But it seems that it was stopped.

> **Arcadum**: The whole time he's kind of seeing this next part, it's almost as if he's seeing it for the first time, which would be indicative of how Cyclops see things. They don't see the present, remember the past, and hope for the future. They see all three pieces simultaneously in a circle, so it seems he is actually experiencing history at the same time as seeing your place in it. He's kinda got a bewildered look on his face, to give you an idea.

> **Xetor**: Curious, that so much power would be found within the simple people of this world. Seven, yes, we see them. The Seven are... reflections.<br>
**Arcadum**: He will look up a look of bewilderment, like an astonishment, over his own face of what the Seven are.<br>
**Ahst**: Are you saying the Seven stopped the calamity?<br>
**Xetor**: Yes. They stopped that which waited, and that which prepared. Seven? Was that the secret? Why did we not see it. Why were we denied sight? To dwell is pointless, for that which was stolen may yet still be gathered. That which we lost may yet be restored. My people might not be forgotten. We must seek the Parthenons. We must restore the threads! Wait, a shattering reflection, the... No! She works so tirelessly! The mirror, it re- No.<br>
**Arcadum**: Pain seems to be etched on the Cyclops face as he recalls pieces of history and time interwoven.

(Religion check: `12`)

> **Arcadum**: As he begins to speak of her and time, you believe that you understand who he's talking about. But he's talking about them as if he knows them, which would be ridiculous. You believe he is speaking about the goddess Raquel, the goddess of Time.
>
> Her duty is to repair Time, which was shattered during the Great Reckoning. Which is the event he has recently lived through in his sight. The Reckoning was a time when Seven mortals rose up and faced the greatest threat that creation has ever known. And now that he has talked in this manner about the Seven being reflections and the shattering of Time leads you to a conclusion. Bonus points if you can guess what it is.<br>
With the Seven being revealed as reflections, rising up to face this threat, that it would seem that the Cyclops encased themselves in amber to escape.
>
> Time is a mirror. It's fragmented in the same way a mirror would be.<br>
The Seven, were a reflection. A reflection of the people stolen from the future into the past to save the Cyclops.

> **Strippin (Ahst)**: He stole the Seven, but their reflections remained, and went on to save the world?<br>
**Arcadum**: That seems to be what he's saying, yes.<br>
**Arcadum**: They stole the Seven and brought them back in time to help him, but their reflections remained, and their reflections are what ended up saving the world.<br>
**Tate**: Is that why time is fucked up right now? And that's what's being repaired?<br>
**Arcadum**: That's what the goddess of Time is trying to do, yes.<br>

> **Ahst**: Was this island hidden by time?<br>
**Xetor**: Ang'galosh, and the other homes of my people, in order to hide themselves from this destruction, had to hide their existence.<br>
**Arcadum**: He will then hold up the amber and say:<br>
**Xetor**: The ritual was always risky, but there is only one thing that blocks a Cyclops sight.<br>
**Moe**: Amber blocks the Cyclops sight?<br>
**Arcadum**: He'll nod.<br>
**Ahst**: So correct me if i'm wrong, but this calamity is over, right? We're good?<br>
**Arcadum**: Xetor will look up to the ceiling, but you feel that it's gaze pierces stone and rock, and looks up towards the sky. Then he will speak, kind of like in a wistful tone.<br>
**Xetor**: I fear that it is not.<br>
The Seven shattered the mirror, but within a mirror reflections remain. Silence and secrets. These were their costs. Their names removed, their names, in amber, removed. But a name is not all of a person. An action, a shadow, a want, a need. They reflect even now. I can feel them. I can see them. The torch is passing. They whisper the Enemy remains.<br>
**Moe**: And uh, who might this Enemy be?<br>

(Following transcript was lifted from Verum Transcripts document, thank you for transcribing it)

> **Moe**: And uh… who might this creature, this enemy, be?<br>
**Arcadum**: The cyclops will look upon a simple question asked by Moe, and as he speaks the words the room becomes heavy, very heavy. While the rest of you might react to this in a very unsettled manner, the Cyclops looks around more in wonder as this question almost seems to manifest itself, and with it the presence of others.<br>

### Sevenic Speech

(The party questions whether the wrong thing was asked, before Lumina begins to play)

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/4Xxon7df1HY?t=2020))

> **Arcadum**: The question lingers within the air, manifests heavy, almost as if a spiritual pressure is pressing down all around you. The fire of the braziers and the amber scones begin to shift and change, the scones rattling. The cyclops looks around in wonder as bit by bit on the edges of sight shadows in the light begin to harden and form. Not shadows in the sense of the Fell, but shadows of memory. Like waking from a dream, the last vestiges, the last touches of thought. Slow but surely, Moe’s question hangs in the air, and then you hear it, the same question repeated, but not with Moe’s voice, but with dozens, upon dozens, upon dozens of others. They start softly, and then slowly begin to build. Louder and louder they rise. You begin to see it, the pieces of stone that form the parthenon in which you stand begin to shift away as vistas, vistas of different places reflected through a cracked mirror.
>
> The cyclops's hair and skin begin to rattle as the magic flows over him. His eye begin to clear. Its grey cost of time and age begins to heal, and like a fog lifted sees clearly. He looks around you, not at you but the pieces reflected within you. Piece by piece each thing that you are and each thing that you represent, reflected by those who came before. As the torch was passed, it has touched  many hands, and now it lies within you and all those that walk the path of heroism, but even here in this one place, although time is reflected, and although existence is mirrored, their shadows yet remain, their flashing strength growing. The cyclops begins to stand, his old body beginning to become young again before your very eyes. Spots of time, refracted and released. In the corner of your eye you see that the mirror showing his spirit is no longer alone, for in the mirror's reflection, you can see them, the shadows made nearly to form, outlines of nameless heroes that once walked the same path.
>
> They say that history repeats itself, but it is more accurate to say that the future has many pieces, and the Great Wheel will always turn for as long as the star is the warden, and within it, the star has seven points, a shield, a guardian, and so it is wheel turns once more, that the mirror, broken and shattered, an act of desperation, might yet be repaired. These pieces lay before you, requiring someone to repair them.
>
> You see visages of others, their colors far clearer, more recent it would seem. You see lizardfolk, you see humans, you see elves. You see them reflected before you. Some of them face a great necromancer atop a tower, others face a growing threat to dragonkind. Others face bandits within the north, and others, invaders to the icy west. These individuals are colored more brightly and then fade. The cyclops looks behind you and you turn to look, and then you see the great weight of time. You see the cusp of the Wheel, and the turn of the circle, and voices begin to call out. Within it, they echo. Their words unknowable, but audible. Barely contained within them the wisdom and knowledge of what is to come, what hasn't come, and what cannot come, and through that you see a star of seven points begin to rise over the cusp of the Wheel, and slowly but surely, your own presence moves towards it. You feel the cyclops’s presence is behind you, standing closer now, youth returned. The five of you stand with him at your back, and your purpose becomes clearer.
>
> Upon this Great Wheel there are pieces yet broken, pieces that must be restored, pieces of the past, specifically, that history must be remembered in order to be healed. The cyclops raises his staff, and within that, light begins to shine outwards. You look upon yourselves and you see the reflections of the Seven more across your own arms and legs, pieces of armor, of robes, of power, of weapons refracted hundreds of times within themselves. Your path is still yours to choose, but whichever path you might take, it will lead to a better future. It will take a chance, you will have to roll the die, but know this: That living by the edge of one's own life, is a Gambler's Delight.

(Post Sevenic Speech, party's reactions)

> **Raost**: What just happened?<br>
**Xetor**: It would seem that you have discovered a reflection. One of the few that yet remained within the parthenons. A reflection in this case represents something that the Seven have done, in this case a question, a question asked too many times. Strange.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Specifically that question has been asked 786 times.<br>

> **Moe**: That was the Seven? Then if we are a reflection of them, then there were other reflections?<br>
**Xetor**: It is difficult to say if you are the reflections of them, or are they the reflections of you? Are they the reflections of ourselves? A strange question, and one that even my sight can provide, yet. Too many pieces are missing, too many secrets unknown.<br>
**Moe**: We need to see the whole picture of the mirror.<br>
**Xetor**: Agreed. We must seek them, we must seek the other homes of my people and their parthenons, and that which was lost must be restored once more.<br>

(`17` History check on planting of the seed.)

> **Arcadum**: The planting of the seed, in this case, is in reference to the planting of the World Seed. Which was planted by the Eldar race and created the Elves, the Dwarves, and the Saurian, or lizardfolk as they're known. But there were people that lived before them, and the Cyclops were one of such people. The map that you saw was not as old as that, which would indicate that somebody came here after they were sealed, or they left some sort of keeper behind.<br>
**Xetor**: Perhaps it may yet still contain what was lost. Take me there.<br>

Raost pulls out the mirror and looks at Xetor again.

> **Arcadum**: When you look at him through the mirror from the back, you see that walking behind him are all of you. You see that it is all of you, but several levels of experience ahead. You see that you are covered in armor, weapons, and scars, that you do not recognize. Mini Raost is not there.

Raost looks at himself in the mirror and mini Raost is there.

Back in the library the party shows Xetor where the map they took once lay:
> ***Xetor** looks through time at the old map and shares the vision with the party.<br>
**Arcadum**: You see one of the shadows of the Seven writing out this map. You see that around you there are what appears to be markings of war etched into the stone, and as the vision fades you then notice these old scars of the walls.<br>
**Xetor**: It seems they knew, but how?

Raost pulls at the mirror in the library looking for shadows and finds some.

> **Arcadum**: As you get closer, you can see several reflections of shadows sitting at a table, much like this one but not quite the same. Each of them have their head in their hands, the weight of their purpose pressing on their shoulders.

Raost tries to touch them, and his hand moves through empty air. It is, after all, a memory.

> **Xetor**: We called them Vega, it is a word in our language that means anew.

Group goes down to the sight complete room.

> **Xetor**: This represents the story of knowledge of my people. It is written here, our history is something I am quite proud of. It was my duty to uphold it, and to keep it safe, and yet here it remains, unseen. I am the last, and my body fails. There will be no more, and the sight will be lost.<br>
**Moe**: Well you managed to do some funky stuff with time before, maybe we can do something like that again, and you don't know what we'll find in those temples around the world.<br>
**Xetor**: Perhaps you're right. Perhaps it is just that I cannot see them.<br>
**Ahst**: We were attacked by elementals, and a voice asked for the amber sword, was that you?<br>
**Xetor**: No, that is most likely the warriors, the warriors that have long since kept Ang'gallosh safe.<br>
I know one thing, Ang'gallosh is safe now, and so we must seek the others as you once said. I see no reason to let the wealth of Ang'gallosh go unused.

Moe asks about the Sky Abound and the star vessel:

> **Xetor**: Long ago my people discovered the power of mirrors, and in that discovery we had found that there are hidden places when a mirror is shown. But the grandest discovery was an accident, one of our elders tripped, and caught his mirror, and that is there that he saw the stars through it. For in the stars is not but an astral sea, and the energy within it is infinite. We used the mirrors to call down the starlight, and to use its might. Be careful that you do not put your mirror to the sky at night, if you are not ready to receive its gifts.<br>
**Ahst**: Raost show him mini Raost.<br>
**Xetor**: My goodness, you have reflected yourself. I see, you inadvertently created a copy of yourself, let me see where it is.<br>
**Moe**: It's located somewhere?<br>
**Xetor**: Not somewhere, somewhen. It seems that he is your family, he is your past, he is your ancestor.<br>
**Arcadum**: Okay, so. You have reflected your great-great-great-grandfather.<br>
**Xetor**: There are some that believe that to travel from time is to go from one place to another, no, time is existence and all is formed simultaneously. A reflection is just that, a reflection.<br>

Raost will move the mirror to show the shadows behind Xetor, and he will immediately move the mirror down.

> **Xetor**: Some things are not meant to be known. I do not mean to deceive you, but the sight is a heavy burden.

---

Xetor leads them to the far eastern room, one of the few they did not explore:
> **Arcadum**: In this room you can see an enormous, glowing, golden, orb, whose reflective surface contains more wealth. So there's actually a sphere of gold that is a mirror portal of wealth inside of it.

The party recieves a gift each from the Cyclopean "stash".

---

The party now needs to decide where to go next, which of the Cyclopean/Vegan isles to visit. Xetor informs them of their options:

> **Xetor**: Ghels'Tahar was our own port city, our own sailors, not the Vega, the whispers of the wind, and the call of the wave.
>
> Tanis Las was the realm of the Night Lord, where our people saw both the sun and the stars. It is where we discovered the power of mirrors, and it is where we first drew power from the stars.
>
> Rodo Ragar' is a place of still waters and quiet reflections, it contains the archives of our knowledge, I hope that it yet remains unmolested.
>
> Exetotar is a place of verdant bounty, of food and of prosperity. It is where we traded, where we commerced, it was a wondrous place, where all manners of rare fruits and vegetables would grow, and the beasts there are something to behold.
>
> Zilot was our realm of warriors who fought with single bladed steel, and lamellar armor, for the way of the blade held power over all.
>
> Vinis Kinith was the crown jewel of our civilization; it was where our elders slept.
>
> Ang'galosh was where magic was the strongest, where the heart of the earth pumped our power to the surface.
