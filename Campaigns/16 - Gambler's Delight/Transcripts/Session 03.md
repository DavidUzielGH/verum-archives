# Gambler's Delight -- Session 03

## Relevant Lore

As the party continue exploring the seemingly abandonded Vega village Ahst walks into a hut and sees a Dreamcatcher:

> ***Ahst** grabs dreamcatcher and disappears.<br>
**Arcadum**: Standing in a miasmic cloud. You breathe in a sickly sweet smell. And all around you it seems that there is nothing, yet there is something. You can feel yourself but you don't feel unwell or sick and the dreamcatcher glows warmly in your hand. As confusion starts to wear off you start to hear:<br>
**Voices**: "Mother? Father? Help his(?), Noo!"<br>
**Arcadum**: Slight voices, barely audible, difficult to understand. Ahst's voice echoes in on itself.<br>
<br>
You see people form out of the clouds. Their shapes discernable, but not so much to see any features of remembrances. You can tell the difference between a man, a woman, and a child but not much more than that. Their voices radiate outward toward you.<br>
**Voices**: "We have to hurry, if we take any longer the ritual will fail."<br>
**Voices**: "I don't think we should do this! We don't know if it's true!"<br>
***Ahst** keeps watching<br>
**Voices**: "I'm not ready, I'm just not ready!"<br>
**Voices**: "Life is fleeting, maybe this is the best."<br>
**Arcadum**: The voices continue to echo to and fro. Like you're hearing the innermost thoughts of individuals moments before the happenings of some whatever it is, it seems as thoug-<br>
***Ahst** interrupts<br>
**Arcadum**: One of the voices reveals something that confirms your suspicions:<br>
**Voices**: "Oh holy amber, please. Unlock the secrets of my own past. May our lords be served, and the eye forever open."<br>
**Arcadum**: You sense feelings of excitement/apprehension.<br>
You feel a disturbance in the dreamlike space you find yourself in. Your mind expands outward, almost like you can see yourself. A swirling miasmic eye comprises the entirety of where you stand and begins to spin, rotating. You are caught in a nearly tornado-like storm of thoughts, dreams, hope, and failures.<br>
***Ahst** lets go of the dreamcatcher.

On the outer edge of the camp a hot spring of sorts. Eustace begins to investigate it:
> ***Eustace** drinks from the koi pond.<br>
**Arcadum**: His hair is set on blue fire.<br>
The blue fire seeps into Eustace's hand.<br>
***Eustace** jumps into the pond.<br>
**Arcadum**: His entire body is cased in blue flames, as his Genasic body is purified. Eustace gains +1 Con.

(Eustace rolls a nat 20 on catching a fish, Arcadum informs Ster and gives him inspiration)

> **Arcadum**: The fish is covered in prismatic scales. You notice there's something odd about it, the way it flows through the water.<br>
As you raise it out of the water the fish becomes inky, almost as if it is a painting in the air, and then it begins to fade up.<br>
***Eustace** swims through the pond
**Arcadum**: He sees fish of all different colors and the pond as a whole represents a painting easel.<br>
***Ahst** takes a couple scales off of a fish.

The party retrieves a pot from the village:
> ***Ahst** dumps a koi in a pot

(Arcadum rolls a d6 and it comes back as a red koi fish with a brilliant crimson hue)

### The Cyclopean Temple

Exploring further into the temple the party comes across a room with strange symbols on the floor and walls as well as a number of oversized sarcophogai:

> ***Eustace** places amber on the sarcophagus and a mirror appears.

(Placing a pot of amber creates a mirror 2ft in diameter.)

Party places the mirror into one of the circles of symbols on the floor.

(Arcadum rolls a `d100=17`. The amber is consumed, and the mirror gains a golden frame.)

> ***Ahst** looks into it<br>
**Arcadum**: She does not see her reflection, but sees instead sees herself. A repeated image of herself.<br>
***Eustace** touches the mirror.

(Arcadum rolls a `d3=2`. Ahst feels a finger pressing against her cheek.)

> ***Raost** puts his blood on the mirror.<br>
**Arcadum**: Raost's reflection becomes clear in the mirror.

(Ahst rolls a `14` arcana.)

> **Arcadum**: Whatever happens to Mirror Raost will happen to Raost.

The party turns to the murals on the wall and tries to make sense of them. Revealing something about a race called the Vega, they ask what they may know about these people. Rolls are made and Arcadum reveals:
> **Arcadum**: Specifically, they were an island bearing, tribal bearing people with an incredibly advanced technology. Specifically the technology gifted to them by the Cyclops. It is unclear whether the Cyclops made the Vega or the Vega made the Cyclops, as their relationship is intertwined. But what you do notice is that they depended on each other, their relationship was symbiotic. However, it seems that the murals describe a great calamity that not only destroyed the Cyclops, but the Vega as well.
<br>
The Calamity is only described as the great Eye.

Inspecting the sarcophagai:
> **Arcadum**: Sarcophagi hold Vega priests to what is described as The Sight Complete. Circles are a way to receive blessings from the Vegan priests.

Inspecting the other things within the room:

> **Arcadum**: The green gas is a portal to the Dream realm, what the Cyclops call the mind unbent.<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/672kDyy.jpg" alt="Green gas in room" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/672kDyy.jpg)

> **Arcadum**: Ritual circles with burning bonfires with ethereal flames in the center of them. The flames burn orange, and red, and green, and blue. Different ethereal colors. In the center of the room there is what can only be described as starlight encapsulated in a giant glass orb.<br>

Returning to the murals on the wall:
> **Arcadum**: These murals dictate something else. These refer to the Sky Abound. Murals indicate what appears to be the night sky and specifically each of the different stars and what they represent. This is where things get fucking PogChamp, because apparently it seems that the Cyclops or the Vega or both of them were able to figure out a way to capture starlight, and that is what you are looking at. They have captured the energy from the stars themselves and placed it within this circular orb.<br>
**Party**: Do they actually look like stars?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes, yes they do.<br>
**Party**: So we're looking at an encapsulated galaxy?<br>
**Arcadum**: Not in actuality, but it looks like it. Big galaxy vibes.<br>

> **Arcadum**: (OOC) Yes, and then all is silent and there is only death.

(Arcana check: `18`)

> **Arcadum**: This is a vessel of pure energy. If it was properly harnessed you could place it within anything. Within a person to restore energy, use it to create items, fuel machines, cure the sick, who knows what else.<br>
<br>
The walls only describe the history of how they acquired it.<br>
<br>
Continuation of the Cyclops making a boat. This time you see the Cyclops figure walks in between hundreds of smaller figures that give them offerings, that the Cyclops then turns into what appears to be a depiction of the sun.<br>
The murals continue, and shows a throne that the people built for the Cyclops figure.<br>
The offerings aren't amber, but the sun at the end could be the star vessel seen earlier.<br>

After exploring more of the temple the party comes to the end of a hallway to the south:
> **Arcadum**: Two braziers of brass hands, human hands not cyclopean hands.<br>
The door has a mural that depicts a great ring, and within that ring is a person, and the ring is being held up by another person.

Looking at the door in the mirror's reflection:
> **Arcadum**: There's a lever on the door in the mirror realm, mirror Raost pulls it and the door opens.<br>
Inside is another statue of a cyclopean dude. The statue is adorned with amber jewelry and glows with light.

> **Arcadum**: Murals in this room depict a vessel being held against a mirror. Like the ring that you saw before, which now you know represents a mirror, and you can see a person in the mirror leave the mirror. Then you see hundreds of people leaving the mirror.

At the far south of the southern room:
> **Arcadum**: There is a great amber crystal. The pillars indicate a curious ritual. There is a man in a ring, the ring becomes a gem, and the man is trapped. Then it shows two rings, and then the gem breaking.

Party faces two mirrors toward the amber gem, and it cracks and frees the cyclops.

> **Xetor**: And so that which was lost has been made whole again. Thank you, small ones, we have much to discuss.

Xetor is the last Cyclops on Kalkatesh.
