### A Violet Eye

Toot touches the Oracle and uses remove curse:

> **Arcadum**: Toot, as you place your hands upon the Oracle, casting your spell, the shadow will turn and will watch your audacity with quite an honest shock of surprise on its face.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, TheNo1Alex, let’s talk. I have good news and potentially upsetting news. The good news is that this was something that I prepared for but did not expect anyone would actually do. You have proven yourself to be quite brave. I also have potentially upsetting news. This roll, should you fail, will not only mean the death of Toot but it will also mean the death of Ronio. For that which you touch and the powers which you meddle with you do not understand. It refracts through time and existence, for you are one of the first in many years to face the Enemy. Therefore, please roll for me a [d20 + 7].

> **Arcadum**: As you place your hands upon the Oracle, you surge the power of divinity directly into her flesh, attempting to remove the foul presence. The creature, unimaginable in its power, is still not omnipotent nor omniscient. It did not expect that a little bald-headed bird would have such audacity. As you reach out toward the Oracle your magic begins to flow into her soul, tainted and chained by this strange presence, and then it begins to unravel. The shadows fall from the girl’s skin. The creature screams. It reaches out towards Toot and grabs him by the throat.

> There is a flash- a flash of memory- a flash of Toot’s memory of walking with his comrades, standing with them on the battlefield, of his upbringing, of everything that he ever was. You see the reflection of your Kenku race, their voices stolen. You see the violet. You see The Herald moving through the sky. You see the suffering that it has caused and then you see through the eyes of another, eyes of an orcish man and his mushroom friend travelling together upon an ancient and hallowed road. You stand before the vestige of fate and you deny it. You feel his tears within your eyes again as his friend falls. You feel him now, walking the Feywild, searching for a place to plant his old friend. Both of you, at the same time, fall to a knee. Your eyes refract into a seven-pointed star. As it shifts and chases itself you can see the shadows of heroes, villains, and ne'er do wells, and vagrants alike, stand up as one as the star is completed and then finally you blink, and the shadow is gone.

> Everyone sees that Toot’s left eye, its pupil is refracted and broken and there is the slight shine of violet light.
