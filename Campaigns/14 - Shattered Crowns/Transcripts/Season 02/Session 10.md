## Relevant Lore

> **Arcadum**: Like stars in the sky Violet light begins to appear around you. And you see it, for what lies beyond the violet vault are the Seven themselves, their remnants, the last vestiges of where they can be found, and then, as it focuses I will now reveal to you where you actually are on the map.<br>
To be clear you are now currently astrally projecting, so you do not have your bodies.<br>
You find yourself standing in the midst of a singular platform, and all around you are violet lights like stars against the backdrop of the black astral sea. They are each of them made in points, almost like a blueprint of construction, and all around you, phantasmal, and ethereal, is that of a tower.<br>
You stand at its base, the great tower is not completed, but it is being built.<br>
There are various Seven, there are various trials, there are various trials that you can ask about and expand upon, and you may choose one to receive a boon from.<br>

Can be a magic item, fighting style, or piece of useful knowledge to use against the Enemy.

> **Arcadum**: Each time you use the vault the Herald will also make a move on the board.<br>
Now that you have unlocked access to this it has caused a chain reaction, as the torch has been passed, and the Cardinal has been renamed, refraction begins to resonate, and as such now every single group will have access to this tower.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Around you there are seven choices:<br>
You see the vestiges of a verdant swamp, and behind it the backdrop of a ziggurat. Upon further inspection you appear to hear the sound of reaming drums, and cries in draconic.<br>
<br>
The second choice. There appears to be a dark cavern, with a beautiful muraled door that bars the way, split in half. And you will see that it is a complex filled with the shadows of the past of ghosts of those degenerates who seek fortune and fornication.<br>
<br>
Number three: A misty jungle, complete with the screams of animals, and the roars of great beasts, and a black sickly ichorous death that moves across the land.<br>
<br>
Number four: Cold frost, harrowing winds, treacherous mountains, and within it a ruin. A ruin where a skeletal lord sits upon a flesh throne of dwarves.<br>
<br>
Fifth: The fifth is an abandoned city, and at the center a cathedral to the various pantheons, and within it no soul stirs, and not a single voice is heard. Only the remnants, only the mockery of life.<br>
<br>
Sixth: A great vault with the face of a veneered dark elf staring down at you. Opulence and wealth fill the area, and a great platinum door fills the way.<br>
<br>
Seventh: Is an island of black sand, and white foliage.
