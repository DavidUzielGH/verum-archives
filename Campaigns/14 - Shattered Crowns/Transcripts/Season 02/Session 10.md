### The Violet Vault

After speaking with the gods of the Dream, Wode sends the group to the edge of The Dream:

> **Arcadum**: The Violet light that kind of shines out from this gate reveal itself to be hardened and opaque and to hardened light. The vault is made out of pure Violet and upon it is the mark of The Seven that seals it shut. Stones radiate with Violet writing on each side and emanate outwards into the Dream. The Dream itself in this particular area seems corrupted and stable. This corruption appears different from what you’ve seen before. It is not wild and manic like a mad dog, but rather focused and sure, with distinct purpose. The gate appears to shimmer slightly, and then slowly, a golden light begins to shine from the stones. And then all grows quiet. A figure walks through the Violet light and through its power, completely undeterred, fearless and confident, and stands before you.

#### Amber Sky

> **Arcadum**: A woman appears before you. She wears a complicated looking ribboned dress with yellow tassels and golden in fabric, with a slight soft green velt along the belt and along the vest. Flowers adorn her dress; they radiate outwards with magic visible to the naked eye. But what you start to notice is that these “flowers” are not flowers, but rather constructs of amber. Across her brown hair she wears a circlet of pure amber and all around her the Violet light seems to shake and his contorted into a willed shape. Not chaotic, nor corruptive, but stable, at least where she steps. She approaches the party and gives a deep bow.
>
> As she smiles, you will see that around her the Violet seems to rumble away, skittering like a chastised child. And she will speak, her voice like melodic bells, their rhythmic song playing all around you, almost as if her words are not heard but rather felt within the mind.

> **Amber Sky**: Weary traveler, my name is Amber Sky. And I welcome you, to the Violet Vault.<br>
**Huckleberry**: Hey uh, how do you make the Violet do that thing where it’s afraid of you?<br>
**Amber Sky**: It is not afraid of me, and those kind of questions are dangerous to ask, centaur.<br>
**Huckleberry**: Oh sorry about that, I’m an idiot.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Oh you are not a fool, you are simply ignorant. There is a difference between stupidity and ignorance, my friend.<br>
**Guy**: Ma’am you just met us, how can you assume all these things?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I assume nothing, I answer only a question.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Listen lady, Oun and Wode sent us here to see if you would make us worthy of using this shard.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Ah, then it is as they told me. You have it with you?<br>
***Scrumpo** raises up the shard with two hands to show her.

> **Arcadum**: She will approach and look down at the star but does not touch it and she will say:

> **Amber Sky**: Then it is true, the wheel turns, but it seems that there is still some hope.<br>

> **Arcadum**: And with that, she will pat Scrumpo on the head. And as that happens, Scrumpo gains clothing.

> **Scrumpo**: Look, I got a problem with this shard and I got a problem with you. I’m tired of being used like some kind of pawn for you and the gods who are too afraid to leave their little hidey holes and whatever realm that they belong to under the guise that things will somehow be worse if they put their necks on the line.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Are you afraid?<br>
**Scrumpo**: No– no I came here to give this shard to you, because we don’t need this shard to accomplish what you all are too afraid to even begin trying to accomplish.<br>
**Huckleberry**: Seems to me like somebody’s afeared.<br>
**Amber Sky**: But my friend, you wield the power. Not I. I will simply provide you guidance on where it may be placed.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Perhaps I can explain. Behind me lies the Violet Vault, where all the power of The Seven past is stored. Just in case. As of now, it is hidden from the sight of the Enemy, one of my few contributions is that I can hide from its sight.<br>
**Big Pipe**: So you want us to go in there?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Oh no, you’re not ready for that. Your bodies would be sundered, and your souls would be lost. But, perhaps, with this.<br>
***Amber Sky** will point down at the shard.<br>
**Amber Sky**: It could be opened to you.<br>
**Huckleberry**: But we would die?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Not if you opened it.<br>
**Guy**: Hold on, what is this even a shard of?<br>

> **Arcadum**: She will take a long moment before she answers that question, and then she will answer it:

> **Amber Sky**: I think it is time that you were told. But first…
***Amber Sky** will place her hand on each of their shoulders, and an amber mark will appear.<br>
**Ikkar**: Not really my color but okay.<br>
**Amber Sky**: This will last for some time, but it is not permanent protection. When it fades, it will be dangerous to speak of what I am to tell you. But for now, speak as you will.<br>
**Guy**: Well alright, what is it a shard of?<br>
**Amber Sky**: It is a shard of the Enemy, it is a shard of The Seven, for their power is one and the same.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How was it made?<br>
**Amber Sky**: It is created when focal points have met, into the crossroads. When refractions meet at their edges, when entities like the one that you faced no doubt, are destroyed, defeated, supplicated, or corrupted.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Uh, follow up question. This place is the Violet Vault, is this the same as what we’re fighting?<br>
**Amber Sky**: The same? No, no, but the power is the same.

> **Arcadum**: She reaches down and plucks a strand of Violet energy and holds it up before you.

> **Amber Sky**: You must understand that this is a tool. A tool of wrongness. Of nothing. Of unfiltered desire. Of the origin.<br>
**Guy**: Wait, hold on, we just had a vial of Violet blood that we gave to Wode, to come to you – you seem like you could have dealt with that.<br>
**Amber Sky**: If it is blood then it is still connected, connected to the Living World, too close.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, quick assumption here, it seems like all of this Violet nonsense is kind of like the corpse and the carcass of the failed ambition of everyone that came before us.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Hmm, not an inaccurate description, but not quite. It is something else entirely. How to explain…there is a wheel.

> **Arcadum**: And as she says this, she will conjure a golden wheel above you.

> **Amber Sky**: Its turning marks the signs of Yggdrasil. And with each turning it moves forwards towards an unknown fate. There are some that try to read this fate, the Matron attempts to read the tapestry made from my light. But hither unto it will always turn. But there was something that happened. Something that is beyond even my sight. It…it broke the wheel. The first tried to stop it, they stood as seven, and with each passing turn, again, and again, and again, they tried. They wrought only delays. They reset the wheel, but the wheel always turns. And so, we come to here. The Seven have faded and those that would follow in their path are not found. It would seem that there is a limit, a limit to the power of refraction. And now the torch passes to you.

> **Arcadum**: When she says “you”, you feel a presence behind you and you can see dozens of other shadows wreathed in golden light. And then they fade as quickly as they appear.

> **Amber Sky**: I know it is difficult to do things based on faith, but some things you must simply have faith within. For you stand on the precipice between two parts. You walk the edge between mortal life and immortal imprisonment. That is the only way that this power can be wielded safely.<br>
***Amber Sky** will present the Violet string.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Lady, listen, the one thing that I’m afraid of is that we’re gonna screw up the same way that those guys did before us. And it feels like the shard and the Violet that you’ve got is like a sure fire way of doing that.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Do you have such little faith in yourself? And your friends?<br>
**Scrumpo**: I have absolute faith in my friends and when I refracted my refractions.<br>
***Scrumpo** points at Guy and the rest of the party.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I have faith in him, in him, in him, in him. But I don’t have faith in the crystal, or the Violet, or anything that seems like a shortcut.<br>
**Guy**: But that’s my point. Everyone keeps telling us that there’s power in refractions, the wizard man, and you, and the gods, and they’re just people, right?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah, I’m an archmage bro.<br>
**Guy**: Well yeah, one of your refractions has a good job so what? I’ve got like a dozen in here that are fuckin’ homeless.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I had a homeless guy too, he’s dead.<br>
**Guy**: Well exactly, so aren’t they just like stupid people? What’s the point that they’re connected?<br>
**Scrumpo**: My point is that I that I think we can do it without this.<br>
**Guy**: No, I’m asking her. What makes refraction so powerful if his homeless one’s dead?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Because you are a chain of links. And not a single circle. No matter how strong a single band may be it is not flexible. It cannot contour, or twist, or turn, it cannot wrap, it cannot be held. Only a mortal soul can refract. That is the truth of it.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you understand what I’m saying lady?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I understand your concern, but what you need to understand is that your soul is refracted. The power that you are afraid to wield, is already within you.<br>
**Guy**: How do we use it?<br>
**Scrumpo**: What if we use the shard to make it so we’re no longer refracted?<br>
**Amber Sky**: That is something that is possible. Drastic.<br>
**Scrumpo**: It’s not gonna hurt anyone is it?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Well, it will hurt the other pieces of yourself.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Will it kill them?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Yes.<br>
**Guy**: What if I were to become the overlord vampire main onea and I commanded all the others.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I don’t wanna do it if it’s gonna hurt them.<br>
**Guy**: I don’t know any of them, I’ve never met them. I could have them all sucking my toes right now.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Your ambitions are amusing. There is no stronger of the refractions. They are reflections of themselves, equal, symmetrical. Do not try to control them. It will lead you to a terrible path.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Just answer one question for me straight lady. If we use relics of The Seven, or things from the past, to accomplish the goal that we are set upon now, which I guess it to make it so that everything doesn’t cease to exist, is that going to make the Wheel repeat?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I do not believe there is a single creature except one who will know that answer and that creature will not answer you. You must have faith that it will, that change is possible, that the fates of all, of The Seven, of our world, and the turning wheel can be stopped. It can be fixed. Let the cycle that the Wheel – that we might yet repair what was broken.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Okay ma’am, I think I understand. Uh, follow up question, what do you think the best way to use this thing is?<br>
**Amber Sky**: It can be used in many ways –<br>
**Scrumpo**: How would you use it?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Hmm, do you miss your home?<br>
**Scrumpo**: No.<br>
**Big Pipe**: No.<br>
**Guy**: No.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Oh.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I do not have a home, anymore. But I miss it dearly.<br>
**Guy**: What if we did like, a wife swap?<br>
**Ikkar**: What?<br>
**Guy**: Like you’ve been doing this for eons, right? So what if we used the thing and like I could take your place. And you can come back in you know, a millennia and we can just switch.<br>

(The party banter a bit)

> **Arcadum**: The Guardian of the Violet Vault will not know how to answer the wife swap question.

> **Amber Sky**: I appreciate your concern to free me, but this is a service. A service that I am happy to do, for there is no one else that can.<br>
**Scrumpo**: No, I want her to answer and say what she would do. Are you saying you would restore your home and then go home or what?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I doubt that even such an artifact is capable of restoring my home. But I will answer your question. I would use it; I would use it to decrease the suffering in the world. From my precipice I look out over the dream and I see the nightmares and dreams that the brothers give out to the people; that are produced. I see them, like a passing wind.<br>

> **Arcadum**: She’ll gesture behind you.

> **Amber Sky**: I see their suffering. There is so much of it, and I would do what I could to stop it.<br>
**Guy**: Well, you’re not going to have to worry about it anymore when the Wheel turns back.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Shut up man, well obviously we’re going to do that, so show us how to do it.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Do what?<br>
**Big Pipe**: How do we use it?<br>

The party bicker for a while about whether or not to use the shard to open the vault. Guy tries to get Scrumpo to suck his toes. Guy’s toes remain unsucked. Eventually they decide to open the vault.

> **Scrumpo**: Get on with it.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Very well.<br>
***Scrumpo** hands her the shard.

> **Arcadum**: As you place the shard within her hand it will refract into a seven-pointed star. And then she will approach the gate. She will lift it up, and it will float into its place. There’s a shattering of glass, reality will crack, and the portal will begin to open. She will approach, and then she will say:

> **Amber Sky**: And so it is done, the way is open. Be warned, the power of the Seven is not to be wielded lightly. Its power is…focused. Unrelenting. Unforgiving. But should you tame it, it will be yours. Take this.

> **Arcadum**: She will hand you an amber statue of herself, and she will say

> **Amber Sky**: This shall return you to me, whenever you would sleep.

#### Inside the Vault

> **Arcadum**: Like stars in the sky Violet light begins to appear around you. And you see it, for what lies beyond the violet vault are the Seven themselves, their remnants, the last vestiges of where they can be found, and then, as it focuses I will now reveal to you where you actually are on the map.<br>
To be clear you are now currently astrally projecting, so you do not have your bodies.<br>
You find yourself standing in the midst of a singular platform, and all around you are violet lights like stars against the backdrop of the black astral sea. They are each of them made in points, almost like a blueprint of construction, and all around you, phantasmal, and ethereal, is that of a tower.<br>
You stand at its base, the great tower is not completed, but it is being built.<br>
There are various Seven, there are various trials, there are various trials that you can ask about and expand upon, and you may choose one to receive a boon from.<br>

Can be a magic item, fighting style, or piece of useful knowledge to use against the Enemy.

> **Arcadum**: Each time you use the vault the Herald will also make a move on the board.<br>
Now that you have unlocked access to this it has caused a chain reaction, as the torch has been passed, and the Cardinal has been renamed, refraction begins to resonate, and as such now every single group will have access to this tower.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Around you there are seven choices:<br>
You see the vestiges of a verdant swamp, and behind it the backdrop of a ziggurat. Upon further inspection you appear to hear the sound of reaming drums, and cries in draconic.
>
> The second choice. There appears to be a dark cavern, with a beautiful muraled door that bars the way, split in half. And you will see that it is a complex filled with the shadows of the past of ghosts of those degenerates who seek fortune and fornication.
>
> Number three: A misty jungle, complete with the screams of animals, and the roars of great beasts, and a black sickly ichorous death that moves across the land.
>
> Number four: Cold frost, harrowing winds, treacherous mountains, and within it a ruin. A ruin where a skeletal lord sits upon a flesh throne of dwarves.
>
> Fifth: The fifth is an abandoned city, and at the center a cathedral to the various pantheons, and within it no soul stirs, and not a single voice is heard. Only the remnants, only the mockery of life.
>
> Sixth: A great vault with the face of a veneered dark elf staring down at you. Opulence and wealth fill the area, and a great platinum door fills the way.
>
> Seventh: Is an island of black sand, and white foliage.

### Leaving The Vault

After the actions the party took within the vault, they head back to speak with Amber:

> **Amber Sky**: You’ve returned? Oh blessed day, I thought you had been lost.<br>
**Ikkar**: We were.<br>
**Big Pipe**: I don’t know what you did.<br>

The Clowns explain the stuff they did in the vault and tower they chose.

> **Ikkar**: What’s the purpose of these towers?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Oh, you returned it.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Well, yeah, that seemed like the right thing to do.<br>

> **Arcadum**: She will smile and put her hands together, and as she does so, the amber light will kind of fade outward.<br>
**Arcadum**: The amber light will wash over each of you, the kindness of walking the righteous path is rewarded. You are all granted the next level.
