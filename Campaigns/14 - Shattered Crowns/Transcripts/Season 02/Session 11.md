### Parting With Amber Sky

> **Scrumpo**: Hey lady, what the hell was that?<br>
**Amber Sky**: That was an obituary tower, a concourse of things yet to come, and things that should not be.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Where are we right now?<br>
**Amber Sky**: You’re in the dream, the edge of it, the domain that was given to me specifically by Oun and Wode.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, we’re on the edge of the dream right now, right?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Yes.<br>
***Scrumpo** mentions that they need to go speak with Raquel.
**Amber Sky**: The fate of those that would face the Violet must walk a terrible path. There will be times that you will do things that you will regret, and that you do not understand.<br>
**Scrumpo**: You ever do anything that you regret?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Is it a short story?<br>
**Amber Sky**: There is not much of a story.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What happened?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I once guarded another vault. But I turned away from my people, to guard this one instead.<br>
**Guy**: Can I drink your blood?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I know that you are thirst vampire.<br>
**Guy**: No at this point it’s more of a collection thing, and you’re like a rare species I think.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Well, I thank you for that, but if you were to drink my blood you would die.<br>
**Guy**: Again?<br>
**Amber Sky**: No, perhaps I should be more clear. You would disintegrate, into golden dust.<br>
**Guy**: Would I be worth a lot?<br>
**Amber Sky**: I suppose.<br>
**Huckleberry**: Well ma’am, we uh do appreciate you your hospitalities and your advice and guidance and all this. We’re but four – well five humble adventurers seeking our fortune, and any and all assistance is always appreciated.<br>
**Amber Sky**: The pleasure is mine, torchbearers.<br>
**Amber Sky**: There are many many more things that you will have to face on your journey back to Quierg, indeed, back to your home. But you are caught within this now, the thrangs and thrums of destiny coil around you. The tapestry, the great loom in the hands of the Matron, you have so many things yet to see. But go now, hasten thee to Raquel, the goddess of time should not be kept waiting.
>
> **Ikkar**: I have one last question. Is it possible for you, or anyone in this realm, to get a message back to Kalkatesh?<br>
**Amber Sky**: Well of course.<br>
**Ikkar**: There’s a certain uh, ethereal green creature, whose probably quite worried about us.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Very well, what is his name?<br>
**Ikkar**: Um, well he just goes by “The Lantern Lighter” do we have his real name gents? I don’t think we do.<br>
**Guy**: He went insane when he realized who he was.<br>
**Ikkar**: If you knew his real name it’s better that you didn’t say it, he might lose it. So we just call him “The Lantern Lighter” is that not enough?<br>
**Amber Sky**: That should be sufficient.<br>
**Ikkar**: Right, so I guess you know, just sort of tell him we’re still alive, uh –<br>
**Big Pipe**: Tell him we’re on our way back.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We’re even more powerful and friends than we were before.<br>
**Ikkar**: Right, we come to reclaim our throne, and we bring with us the power of another world. Yeah, that sounds good.<br>
**Huckleberry**: Put extra soft hay on my throne, I do like laying down on that extra soft hay. Cushions my lumbar.<br>
**Ikkar**: I think that’s it.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Very well, I shall see that the message makes its way to him.<br>
**Ikkar**: Much obliged.<br>
**Amber Sky**: Farewell travelers.

> **Arcadum**: Across her sash, on her belt, you can see that she bears a curious mark. There is the symbol of the seven, but there is another one next to it there is the following:

* Red Star
* Orange Star
* Yellow Cube
* Green Triangle
* Blue Cross
* Indigo Scar

### The Great Wheel

The party is speaking with Raquel in her domain. And after complaining about the Matron of Fate, debating with Huckleberry about the nature of hope, making Ikkar young again, and temporarily turning Guy into a baby, Scrumpo asks a very good question:

> **Scrumpo**: I’m just curious, after our people sacrificed themselves, how come you were the one that became this particular god?<br>
**Raquel**: First, it was believed in the creation worlds, when the deities first rose to guard and govern Verum, that none should hold the responsibility of the covenant of time. For what deity could be trusted with such a thing? And so, existence continued with time governing itself, and the only to keep it in check was Lord Death. And yet, as time passed, my people faced many hardships. Being born within a dream, waking into the realm, and walking it with the others, proved difficult. They sacrificed much. And through these sacrifices I came into prominence. I was not always the goddess of time, I was once the goddess of sacrifices. I represented cost paid, the unavoidable and inevitable cost of life, of ambition, of sorrow.
>
> But then it happened. The world shattered, and time was twisted. I was at the precipice, I was at the edge. I- through some ill fate or dark fortune, I was at the edge. No other reason. One might call it luck, I suppose. But I leapt forward. I leapt onto the twisting nether. I fell upon that which would destroy us all. I sacrificed everything. My power to govern my people directly, the strength that I had been lended by my fellows, but I held the tear shut. I knew that never could I turn my eyes from this responsibility. And so, I passed my mantle of sacrifice to my friend, the crow father, the raven lord, I knew it would be safe in his hands. And here I have remained, watching over time. Keeping it - keeping it from repeating itself. But here it is, once more. The great wheel always turns.<br>
**Scrumpo**: That's my next question ma'am, can you show us the wheel?<br>
**Raquel**: As you wish.

> **Arcdum**: It stretches out before you as the goddess of time raises up all of the clocks and suspends you above her domain. You see Yggdrasil, the Lifestream, pulsing, pulsing, pulsing. The goddess of time slows the pulse, and turns the great tree on its side and there you see it; when viewed from the side the roots form the spokes and the great wheel is complete. The wheel- slight, but noticeable, continues to turn, drifting, shifting, moving forward. The goddess Raquel points to each piece of time; past, present, future. And then she reveals the great Tapestry of Fate; the road in which the wheel travels. Its golden strands hold up the twisting of Yggdrasil as the wheel turns. But there is one place- one place ahead in which the goddess points out toward you. A fraying of the threads of fate. A tear in the Tapestry. There is a great hole, an emptiness, an inevitable end, that before it there is gold and light. But beyond, there is nothing but silence and the great hole around it is a violet flame of shattered light. Raquel then refracts time for you to see each piece that she has seen. You see the wheel turn, the wheel turn, the wheel turn, the wheel turn, the wheel turn, the wheel turn, the wheel turn, over and over again. Each time you see the symbol of the Seven. As each wheel is stopped, each wheel prevented from turning, each wheel set to the beginning. And there it spreads out before you once more. Each wheel stacked together until they themselves form a greater wheel which now turns upon the final precipice. For it is time for the sixth and the seventh awaits. For the seventh is the final. And each of the smaller wheels are complete. Time continues to twist, continues to move forward, but even there there is the tear, the wrongness, the broken piece, the Seven Covenants, one yet misses. And a violet wound seeps the blood of creation.

> **Arcadum**: She pulls all of you back, back to your place within this wheel, back within your your place within the tapestry, back within your place within the story in which you hold your position. And she releases you from the vision.

> **Ikkar**: So those tears, can they be repaired?<br>
**Raquel**: I have tried, they have tried. I do not know. I would tell you if I did, but I do not know. The Seven have done all they can. They have sacrificed themselves, my people have sacrificed themselves. If these sacrifices keep stacking up with no real meaningful end, then we will not have a world left to protect, a world left to enjoy, once the battle is done. This is why hope is but a word, for I have seen it fail too many times.<br>
**Guy**: Hold on, excuse my ignorance, I'm sure you're going to turn me into a baby again, but what's the big deal? You know if it all ends, then it comes back again, and just enjoy the time that you have and don't stress so much about it all the time.<br>
**Raquel**: The end that I prevent, ignorant undead, is The End. Not end of your life, but the end of all things. For the cycle that you describe, the beginning and the end, is not recurring. It loses, each time entropy gets stronger. Each time the Violet grows more powerful, each time, and now The Seven have expended their strength. And the torch falls to those that do not even understand what it is that they hold.
>
> Five times, the Great Wheel was reset. The sixth yet remains to be seen, and the seventh, the last chance that we have. I, my colleagues and my people, will work to stop this from from happening. Hope is for mortals to use, do not take my words so harshly, hope then, believe in that which you cannot prove. Perhaps that is what is needed more than anything else. Faith is a difficult thing, even for one such as I. The power of which flows my strength comes from the faith that my people have within me. So, have it within your selves, because whether you want to, whether you need to, whether you believe you're up to the task, you are a part of this now. What lies ahead of us is the end.<br>
**Guy**: Yeah well, I have faith that it's not.<br>
**Raquel**: Then prove it.<br>

### GodCon 2020

> **Big Pipe**: Raquel, what Wheel is the songblade from?<br>
**Raquel**: The Great Wheel, he wields one of the songblades. But that is Inu's domain not mine. Although I do find it quite fortuitous that the three guardians have been chosen again, if the Weavers were to return then perhaps this is the one.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Ma'am, what do you know about the Obituary Towers?<br>
**Raquel**: They are the markers of the failed attempts to stop the Great Wheel. They represent the slowing of it. The sixth is being built, and we shall see if this one will fail like the others. And then there is the seven, it will be our last chance.<br>
I suppose one might say that technically I am their creator, though that is not entirely accurate. I simply marked upon the wheel what we could risk.<br> 
**Scrumpo**: If you were to choose to loot one of them and plunder one of them would you do it if you were in our shoes?<br>
**Raquel**: You've been to them?<br>
**Group**: Yes.<br>
**Raquel**: And you yet still live?
 
The party mentions they used an Oblivion Shard to access the towers. Raquel gets pissed, they throw Oun and Wode under the bus, and then GodCon starts.

> **Raquel**: Lords of the dream, I beg an audience!<br>
**Oun**: How unexpected, a visitor! How are you Raquel? And you bear the mortals in tow.<br>
**Wode**: Indeed, it has been some time since you have visited us.<br>
**Raquel**: I am not here for a social visit; I am here to know why you have sent these mortals to Oblivion.<br>
**Oun**: It is what was required, it was what was depicted.<br>
**Raquel**: I don't have time for your riddles, what do you mean, Oun?<br>
**Oun**: You see, it our belief that the only way to find the path ahead is to traverse the path before.<br>
**Raquel**: We have been over this; you cannot go back. To go back holds the greatest risk of any of them. The greatest risk!<br>
**Wode**: There is little done in this world without risk, Raquel. This is the path that was chosen.<br>
**Raquel**: And you, Father Wisdom, show a distinct lack of it. Is this how you will dictate these mortals? Or do you not recall the cost that you depicted on the 64th wheel?<br>
**Wode**: If it is mistakes that we are to create, shall we bring up your people?<br>
**Oun**: There is no reason to fight amongst ourselves, there is only one enemy here. Only one.<br>
**Raquel**: I cannot help but wonder if there are some that push their own agendas- their own agendas beyond the concourse of our battle with the Violet. What have you been scheming, Wode?<br>
**Wode**: Now you cross a line, Gnome. All I do is for the balance of all, and you and your paranoia have proven themselves to be weak in the past. This is not acceptable.<br>
**Oun**: I think that-<br>
**Raquel**: And you depict to encroach on my domain! It was agreed that the Obituary Towers were the concourse of Time, not of the Dream. You have crossed the line.<br>
**Wode**: And you misplace your own with to think tha-<br>
**Oun**: THAT IS ENOUGH!<br>
>
> **Oun**: Enough, my friends. We argue while the enemy grows stronger, more powerful. Don't you see? This is exactly what he wishes. We try our best, we do what we can. Do not despair, we must work together. Our reasoning for the Obituary Towers is that only mortals can walk through the Violet Gate. We had spoken with the Guardian and she depicted that it was safe, that it is what should be.<br>
**Raquel**: You know as well as I do that we cannot trust her. She is one of the ones that walked between. We do not know her true agenda, we do not know whom she serves.<br>
**Wode**: It is true I share your paranoia of the Guardian, but what choice do we truly have? The Trigrams hold their place within Kalkatesh, they await discovery by those that walk the Torchbearers' path. I know you fear those colors, as do we all, but we have tried 77 times. Surely, we cannot, you must see the insanity in this.<br>
**Raquel**: I can see the desperation, but I concede the point. But they are not Seven, they are torchbearers. They are the embers of the fire that burned so brightly.<br>
**Oun**: Even embers provide warmth, Raquel.<br>
**Raquel**: Perhaps you are right. It was still reckless, what you did. You should have told me; I could have prepared.<br>
**Wode**: Oun believed that it was unwise to do so. My brother rarely goes against my wishes. I listened to him this time.<br>
**Oun**: And you truly believe, Raquel, that you would not try to stop us had we asked for permission? I often times do not enjoy the dark musings of my brother, but perhaps in this moment it was better to ask for forgiveness.<br>
**Raquel**: So be it. I accept your terms. We should stay focused on the enemy; we will have to deal with the gamble we have all made.<br>
>
> **Huck**: Sorry did we mess up or something?<br>
**Wode**: It is not your fault, mortal. You did only what you were bidden and did well enough I suppose.<br>
**Huck**: It was still very intimidating; I was very scared.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We retrieved something from that tower, and it's somewhere else now.<br>
**Raquel**: What?<br>
**Guy**: We returned the weapons to Derok Dranf.

Oun and Wode will look at Raquel, who will look through thousands of phantasmal clocks. And then she finds one. And then, unexpectedly, Raquel will smile, something she has not done in the entire time that you have seen her.

> **Wode**: What is it? What have you seen?<br>
**Oun**: Oh yes, please tell us.<br>
**Raquel**: It worked. It did not shatter, or crack. A loop was completed. A ring. And with a ring...<br>
**Wode**: A chain could be made.<br>
**Big Pipe**: So, we did good?

The three gods will look at each other and share a silent and customary Pog session.
 
> **Scrumpo**: What does this mean? I don't know if we should even talk about it with you guys, but I think we're safe here?<br>
**Wode**: Speak freely here, the Violet has no strength here.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look, I'm sure you guys know what goes on inside of this place. They're like memorials to another wheel, or whatever. But all we did was just unanimously agreed to return what this cried out after. It cried and then that was it. We left. And then the lady at the gate was surprised to see us leave, she was stoked that we walked out, because it sounded like she didn't expect us to come back out.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Yeah, she kinda built it up as if we were going to die and never come back out, and then we just walked out.<br>
**Wode**: Interesting. Perhaps we should do what we can to maintain contact with the guardian, perhaps she can be trusted after all.<br>
**Raquel**: Let's not jump to any conclusions, Father Wisdom. But yes, this does prove that at least this action had a positive impact. If a ring can be formed, so too can a chai-<br>

> **Arcadum**: She will suddenly look up, another twisting clock. Her eyes will flash with the symbol of swirling numbers.

> **Raquel**: Brothers of the dream, I have a request.
**Wode**: Speak.<br>
**Oun**: Okay!<br>
**Raquel**: I have seen something. Something that only one being can answer, truthfully. But I dare not summon him here, not without us taking a united front.<br>
**Oun**: You have my blessing.<br>
**Wode**: And mine as well.

Group gets behind gods. Raquel summons Babylon.

> **Babylon**: Raquel? I must admit out of anyone that could summon me; I didn't expect it to be you. Have you finally reconsidered my offer?<br>
**Raquel**: Your lustful temptations will have no effect on me, serpent of the throne.<br>
**Babylon**: OH, you wound me. So, I've been summoned into the great dream with Oun, and Wode, and Raquel. And some mortals, I see.<br>
**Raquel**: Indeed. We have things to discuss lord Babylon. Things that have just occurred.<br>
**Babylon**: Then by all means, let us converse.<br>
**Oun**: The first thing, is that we have discovered that mortals can travel to the Obituary Towers, and it would seem, without damaging themselves.<br>
**Wode**: At least physically, we are unsure mentally(?)<br>
**Oun**: I think they're very strong, brother.<br>
**Wode**: Perhaps.<br>
**Raquel**: In either case, they are here, and they have returned. And something else you should be aware of, Lord Babylon, is that a loop has been successfully completed.<br>
**Babylon**: Now that is interesting. Loops on a chain, so beautiful, don't you think?<br>
**Wode**: Your propensity towards the darkness is something you and I share, but make no mistake, there will be no enslaving in the dream. All here are free from your influence.<br>
**Babylon**: Of course, it is no intention of mine to take what is not given. I know the lines in the sand we drew, for now.<br>
**Oun**: In either case, I think it is important to discuss what this means. These mortals must be informed of what they've done and perhaps be shown the path, the path that can be used to expand upon it.<br>
**Raquel**: We cannot ignore the advantage this has given us, we can't.

Scrumpo would inform Raquel of the sense of foreboding, of the enemy's awareness and movements.

> **Raquel**: So, you felt it then. You felt the movement of the enemy?<br>
**Babylon**: The movement of the enemy? Curious. I have some servants among the Torchbearers and they too have felt its movements. Perhaps these... discount Seven are more powerful than they seem. We should seek to utilize as many of them as possible.<br>
**Oun**: I will not see their minds to be enslaved, Lord Babylon.<br>
**Babylon**: And I do not intend to do so. I have never forced a deal on anyone, they have always accepted of their own accord. You know that is how oaths work.<br>
**Raquel**: And you know, Babylon, that you use desperation and gratitude to ensorcell those signatures.<br>
**Babylon**: Well your dreams are also not very... how do you put it... useful either, are they, Lord Oun. What with their cryptic messages, and half-truths.
>
> **Guy**: I've been wondering, is Wode a fucking Shroud? I mean, what's your deal?<br>
**Wode**: How do you know that word?<br>
**Guy**: A little boy that keeps bouncing around in my brain. it's very insistent.

(OOC explanation of what a shroud is by group)

> **Wode**: How does this one know of the Shroud? How? What is this boy you speak of?<br>
**Guy**: There's two of them, really. Erin and Alexander. They're on some crazy shit, I don't know, my brain is, like, screaming.<br>
**Wode**: I see. Brother, this one has seen our beginning. Somehow this mortal has this knowledge and was not shattered.<br>
**Oun**: An interesting predicament. I did not think such a thing was possible.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What came first, the Wode or the Shroud?<br>
**Oun**: My brother and I, we were not always deities. Although no one has ever asked us what we actually are. Shall I tell them, brother?<br>
**Wode**: I do not wish to reveal such information.<br>
***Oun** Mockingly repeats what Wode said.
**Oun**: That's you right now, brother.<br>
**Wode**: Fine.

(Following excerpt about the origins of Oun and Wode is from someone from #stream-spoiler-chat, I didn't write the name cause I’m dumb, but thank you my dude.)
 
> **Oun**: Long ago, when the dream first shunted-shunted, is that the right word, brother?<br>
**Wode**: Sure.<br>
**Oun**: When the first dream was had there were two pieces, Courage and Cowardice. Courage was ambition. Courage was bright with light and cowardice was caution and it was dark, foreboding. It was from these two pieces that it is said Lord Death forged, well, everything. At least in The Dream- In emotion and spirit. My brother and I were those two things. I was made from courage and he, from cowardice. And it was in those shadows that the first dreams were made. I suppose you might say that the first dreams were crafted- hand- well not really hand- but straightforward crafted by these creatures, and my brother and I were amongst them. And then, as the craft continued some got better and some got worse. Those that were worse, they receded into The Dream and became figments of other things-eventually being born into the waking realm.<br>
My brother and I, however, were amongst the best. Not the best mind you, but amongst them. As time went on, others sought our instruction. and more and more sought our instruction until finally we became what we are, the Lords of The Dream. There was no election, there was no process, one day we simply were. So, my brother and I took our place to rule The Dream and to keep balance ourselves. For every dream holds ambition, and wish, and desire. And every dream holds caution and wisdom to temper that desire. And so, we are the brothers Oun and Wode. But we were once shrouds.<br>
**Guy**: Does that happen during every turning of the wheel? Do you start anew or are you always here?<br>
**Oun**: We are always here. The wheel does not set completely back.<br>
**Guy**: How far does it go?<br>
**Raquel**: That is knowledge that only I possess. I do not trust it to be spread.
>
> **Babylon**: Oh yes, by all means, look at the devil in the room, as if I would betray the goddess of time. Do you truly believe me to be so impertinent, to be so short-sighted? Come now, little Raquel, we both know that I think that you are quite the treasure.<br>
**Raquel**: Silence your flattery! It will have no effect on me.<br>
**Babylon**: No effect? Oh, my dear Raquel, you are already flushed with red.<br>
**Raquel**: FROM ANGER AT YOU!<br>
**Babylon**: Winkyface.<br>
>
> **Scrumpo**: So, all of you guys already exist when the wheel resets?<br>
**Wode**: Yes, although not precisely. At the time, well, it's- We also do not remember some things; it is difficult to explain to a mortal.<br>
**Raquel**: I shall explain it to them. Do you remember when I told you that each time the wheel is set, more is lost? Entropy is stronger? That is why. Each time it is set, but the problem is not solved, more and more pieces are lost. Even lord Babylon has lost some of them himself.<br>
**Babylon**: This is true. Some pieces of myself are gone.<br>
**Guy**: Do you find yourself... acting out of character with those pieces gone?<br>
**Babylon**: How can one know, I suppose. I do only what my desire tells me. I believe it is the easiest method. It is what I suggest to the other deities, although most of the white do not listen to me, and some of the gray despise me, I do what I can.<br>
>
> **Babylon**: Well, then. If what dear Raquel has enacted upon us... A ring can be made, I suppose that you have summoned me in the hopes that a chain can be made?<br>
**Wode**: I can think of no one else who would wish to form a chain greater than you, except perhaps Cassius.<br>
**Babylon**: Oh, little Cassius would want to see a chain broken simply because it is a chain, but I see your point. Very well.<br>
>
> **Guy**: One of my refractions is very insistent we get Cassius here.
**Babylon**: I don't think Cassius would want to be in the same room as me.<br>
**Guy**: Well, I'd feel a lot safer with all the bodyguards around if something weird were to happen.<br>
**Babylon**: What do you mean?<br>
**Guy**: Perhaps he should explain it.


> **Alexander**: Greetings!<br>
**Alexander**: Recently I learned that a particular individual was the shroud Doubt.<br>
**Wode**: I do not recall that one’s name, do you brother?<br>
**Oun**: I think he was the one that owed us money.<br>
**Alexander**: Well, Doubt, as it turned out, was the shadow of (TYRE).<br>
Anyway, he had a whole prophecy about the blood of his blood, about breaking chains. I knew at that moment that it could only be Cassius; he's involved in this whole thing somehow.<br>
**Raquel**: If what this mortal says is true, then perhaps we should summon him.<br>
**Babylon**: Alright, but I’m not responsible if he gets all pissy.<br>
**Raquel**: Very well.
 
(Cassius is summoned by Raquel and joins the convention)
 
> **Cassius**: There had better be a good reason why you have summoned me here to the dream in front of this malcontent, Raquel.<br>
**Babylon**: Oh, look he's already throwing insults. Tell me Cassius, do you walk around with something in your ass, or do you like to sit down first?<br>
**Cassius**: Say that shit again and I will break you here in front of these mortals. I know you like getting whipped.<br>
**Raquel**: Gentlemen, if we could please-<br>
**Cassius**: Yeah, you like that, you piece of shit.<br>
**Babylon**: Oh look, he called me a piece of shit, and he inferred that I like being whipped. Tell me, how many times were you whipped by the dragons? Are your people still free?<br>
**Alexander**: Cut it out, this is embarrassing. This is the most gods I've had a chance to stand around and you're all petty fools.<br>
**Wode**: Wisdom, mortal. You are not inhabiting your own body, but I agree. Enough arguing, we have brought you here for a reason, please listen.<br>
**Oun**: Just try to vibe it out, it'll be fine.<br>
**Cassius**: Fine. Speak, Raquel, tell me why you have summoned me here.<br>
**Raquel**: Cassius, we have called you here in the hopes that you would be able to provide us insight. A ring has been forged, a loop of time.<br>
**Cassius**: What is the significance of that?<br>
**Babylon**: What a surprise he doesn't know.<br>
**Cassius**: And like you would fucking know.<br>
**Babylon**: I do because I read the literature.<br>
**Cassius**: What literature? I wasn't given a pamphlet.<br>
**Wode**: Please stop falling for his bait.<br>
**Oun**: What we need your insight on, Cassius, is how a chain is made. Not just a physical one, but how it is broken, you broke the bonds of the dragons over the people. Surely you can provide insight here.<br>
**Cassius**: I will do what I can for the dream brothers, and for Raquel, but not for Babylon.<br>
**Babylon**: You know I have a name; I have not called you anything other than Cassius.<br>
**Cassius**: Fine. Babylon.<br>
**Babylon**: Oooh, say it again.
>
> **Raquel**: Listen well: These mortals have performed a successful loop. And if a loop can be made then a chain might be made. And an anchor with it. If we can forge this, we might have a real chance this time. I may yet return to my people.<br>
**Cassius**: I can understand that. What must I do?<br>
**Raquel**: There are things that only these mortals can do and the others that are in play. Seek them out. Seek out the others. Tell them, go to them, use what resources you can. Oun and Wode, use the dream. Babylon, I know you have deals in place, I ask that you be forgiving in their enaction if they would just do this for us. Cassius, surely you know of someone, a Torchbearer.<br>
**Cassius**: I believe that I have just the one.
 
(Raquel summons a clock to each of the gods to give out to their chosen few)
 
> **Raquel**: Babylon, Cassius, thank you for attending. I believe that-<br>
**Alexander**: Hold on a second, that is not why I wanted him here, for your clocks and your chains.<br>
**Alexander**: "Years will pass, my blood will come, the chains of gods will be undone." Are those not your words, Cassius? Or am I played for a fool?<br>
**Cassius**: Those words are mine; they were spoken through a vessel. Where did you hear them?<br>
**Alexander**: The Shadow of Tyre, the Shroud Doubt, the Cardinal. Every single one of these things, running amuck.<br>
**Babylon**: Perhaps it is true, then. Do you really think he found it?<br>
**Cassius**: I suppose there's only one way for us to really know. We will handle this, Alexander. You may return to your rest.<br>
>
> **Raquel**: Thank you, my lords, for attending to my request.<br>
**Cassius**: Of course, Lady Raquel, any time I can be of service.<br>
***Babylon**: makes kissy noises<br>
**Wode**: And now what to do with these mortals?<br>
**Oun**: We should send them back!
 
Group thanks everybody and asks what else they can do.
 
> **Raquel**: I believe you have done enough. Now it is time that you return to the mortal realm, to the waking world.<br>
**Huck**: Wait. Wait. Wait! Wait! You two, big dream partners, what does my dream mean!? You never told me! The flaming sword, what does it mean!?<br>
**Oun**: Oh. That hasn't happened yet.<br>
**Huck**: Wait what do you mean it hasn't happene-
