### Warning From An Aged Aarakocra

An old Aarakocra is with the group the party has come to talk to. At first it mostly rambles like a senile old person:

> **Arcadum**: And then he will suddenly speak with clarity “You must seek the tome. The tome that is third, three of seven have yet to be found. The third must be found. Time- time drifts away piece by piece The Herald may yet stay. The third tome can be found hidden within the mind of a beast of three heads. I see it brother, I can see it brother! It comes! It comes for me! It comes for me!”
>
> He will grip your hands closely, tightly, pull you close, sputtering whispers, “Keep safe the Shattered Crowns for they will be needed. Heads they must adorn for what comes will shatter the gates.” And with that the old Aarakocra will collapse in your hands, limp.

(Group makes medicine rolls)

> **Arcadum**: Unfortunately this Aarakocra has reached the end of its life, such is the way of these things. But there is something else. As you take a closer look Ikkar, your sharp eyes and medicine knowledge reveal to you that there is something very wrong. As you look closer you see something you did not notice before. The brand upon his neck begins to glow softly with violet and three points on the star break away. And then you see the violet veins move through the creature’s neck and flesh.

### A Violet Eye

Everyone steps away, but Guy who drinks the blood.

> **Arcadum**: One moment please.
>
> You begin to drink the creature’s blood moments before it erupts in violet flames.

(Jokes; Con save: `16`)

> **Arcadum**: As Guy drinks the blood of the dying creature erupting in violet flame, the infected blood gets into Guy’s system. Now this is going to have some pretty wild effects. First things first, following the rules technically as written- oh god.
>
> The corruption enters your body. Your natural vampirism is able to extract nutrients and power from blood and so it does the same thing in this case. But the power that you receive is far more dangerous than any blood magic. Violet light streaks up through Guy’s fangs leaving etchings upon his face as it moves up into his left eye. The pupil shatters and as it does it begins to almost be speckled with violet light and starts to grow. This is going to be, obviously, a bad thing. But there is also something that is attached to it. Because you see something. The vision revealed to you in your left eye is that:
>
> Across the waves of Bloodwave Bay, on another island you see through the eye of another. An eye that stands before a great and terrible beast surging with violet fire of which in whom’s grip is held a small girl, an oracle. You reach out with a feathered hand and you release the creature’s grip. Through it you see other reflections. All across Kalkatesh, all across time you see them. Each time a sword raised, a spell wielded against the same enemy. A final flash is that of The Herald just above constantly in the view of the sky. Its burning violet light a reminder of what is to come but you see something else. Your eye continues to refract. Your eye continues to shatter for as one has the blessings of the Kenku you have the  blessings of the dead. You see them now, a great well of souls just below the sands. This well of souls a foundry, a focal point, a leyline, a power source. It is where the Scarab Lords yet draw their strength. It is where their servants yet sleep. But you also feel another gaze, the gaze of The Herald looks for this place. It pierces sand, and stone, and flesh, and bone. It wants what is there. It will have what is there. The gaze shifts towards the surface. There, just above the foundry, is the symbol of the Bane of Man.
>
> The vision fades and Guy falls to the ground unconscious. Blood, a violet ichor seeps from his left eye.

### Violet Into A Mirror

Big Pipe decides to collect a sample of this blood. Guy awakens and asks what happened to him. The party tries to explain, and in a moment of seemingly good recollection, Big Pipe holds up the shard of the mirror they collected from the Lord of Flowing Water's underground pyramid to Guy’s face:

> **Arcadum**: Bahroo, as Big Pipe holds up the mirror shard towards Guy’s face there is something that you notice. The first thing that you notice is that when you hold up the mirror to Guy's eye the pupils begin to shift and spiral almost repairing themselves. You also see all of the violet leave his eye almost as if you have healed him.
>
> Guy, as it leaves your eye and you look within the mirror you see the violet leave a smiling face behind before it disappears through the magic mirror.
