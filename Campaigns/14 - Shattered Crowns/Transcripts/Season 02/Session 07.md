### Conversation w/ Arendell

> **Arendell**: First, you must understand what Quierg is. There are many that call him a whale and while that is technically true he is not a whale like the creatures of your world or the other worlds we have seen. Quierg is a anomaly, a run-off you see, of errant emotional energy given form. Quierg is actually the combined emotions of the people within focused into a point. It is why when the mood of the realm becomes too discordant the whale begins to break apart.<br>
**Guy**: Well, hold on a second. Then how did it form in the first place?<br>
**Arendell**: And that is the question. A question that I will do what I can to answer, but first, precautions.<br>
**Arcadum**: Arendell will remove the top parts of his robe and there are two sigils that appear on his chest. On his left pec there is the sigil of the seven-pointed star. And on his right pec is another sigil that you do not recognize.<br>
**Arendell**: This is the symbol of the Seven, and this is the symbol of the Cardinal, and that is what we must speak of.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, my Gleis boys, your eyes refract as memories from your other forms poor into your mind. What you see--the symbol of the cardinal--is exactly the same as the symbol of the Stranger.<br>
**MoonMoon**: So he was here too.<br>
**Ster**: How was Discord related to The Stranger?<br>
**Arcadum**: I don’t know if you recall, but do you remember why Discord acted the way that he did?<br>
**Ster**: I thought he was The Stranger, but his memories were all messed up.<br>
**Arcadum**: I’m not sure if you guys ever got to the bottom of it, but Discord, in the Gleis campaign, do you remember what VORB did to him? VORB essentially was able to stabilize Discord and the reason that Discord was unstable is because The Stranger, or Discord, was unable to actually finish their mission. Now, I do not believe that you actually found out what the mission was in Gleis because you were too busy dealing with Oloken-mc’fuckin’hai, so there’s that, but-<br>
**Ster**: Actually yeah, I was asking the other day, who was the alchemist that we ended up defeating? I like can’t remember his name at all.<br>
**MoonMoon**: He was the soul-sucker guy.<br>
**Ster**: He like- he appears all the time, and like, he was a common occurrence, or something.<br>
**MoonMoon**: I cannot remember his name, I just remember how he died, like a bitch.<br>
**Arcadum**: His name started with T.<br>
**Ster**: See, I thought it was Tyre.<br>
**Arcadum**: That is correct. So, now that you have this knowledge, now we can explain who the Cardinal actually is. Arendell will explain that the Cardinal was the translator to the Seven, who is the one that stood as the bridge between the forbidden knowledge and the knowledge that the Seven must wield. And the Cardinal, the original Cardinal that is, was the great wizard Tyre.<br>
The traitor, the exile, the [dementante](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=fr&tl=en&text=dementante). So, now that’s been revealed. The Cardinal Tyre, his prime purpose was to do the things that The Seven could not. The Seven had to remain pure, they had to remain heroic, so Tyre broke as many rules as possible in order to try and find an edge for them to face the enemy. Because the enemy could break any rule it wished and would only gain more power as it did so.
>
> So Tyre took it upon himself to see which covenants could crack, to see which rules could be broken, and to see which souls could be shattered. Tyre’s sacrifice caused him to furl into madness, but it is believed that he completed his mission. Or at least some of himself did. For one of the ways that Tyre was able to try and break as many rules as possible was to split himself into different phylacteries and with them simulacrums. And he traveled the stars searching for the truth of the enemy. There are three pieces that Tyre split himself into: his Shadow, his Soul, and his Heart. The Stranger traveled to three places and you have found one of them. You have found where the Soul of Tyre may be found.

> **Arendell**: Already the forces, the forces of Life move at Inu’s quiet command. Already there are three individualistic groups that seek to claim the old Labyrinth where Tyre commenced his works. Perhaps if they are able to unravel the Cardinal’s madness they can find the truth at the end. However, it will all be for naught if the hidden pieces are not returned. Therefore, your task is simple. You wish to leave Quierg. Leave Quierg you will, but you will leave it- you will leave it because you have other places to travel. I do not believe that you are not able to come here for no reason and we shall see that that reason is made paramount. It was foretold that I would see a man named Azolon and instead it is you, but I have learned not to question such things, for the trials of life face against the enemy’s coming. The Herald beckons and we have not time to dawdle. So, if you wish to leave Quierg, you must first reclaim the Soul of Tyre which lies within the Gullet of Quierg, in the Maelstrom.<br>
**Guy**: But how does that get us to leave?<br>
**Arendell**: Once you have reclaimed the Soul of Tyre, then you will have the power, the strength required in order to cross the Astral Sea. I have already made arrangements on your behest. It is a simple task, truly.<br>
**Guy**: Now, hold on. You’re very powerful and you’ve lived here, presumably, why don’t you have it?<br>
**Arendell**: Because my mind is unable to handle this knowledge. I am not a refracted soul.<br>
**Guy**: Why don’t you just refract your soul?<br>
**Arendell**: Because only those that have seen the mirrors of this world can do so and I cannot see them.<br>
**Scrumpo**: It feels bad, because I feel like you’ve lived your entire life and you’re clearly powerful, but you can’t actually do anything.<br>
**Arendell**: I could see how one might think that, but I have found purpose in my life, and I serve it- I serve Lord Inu with all of my heart.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Who is Inu?
>
> **Arendell**: Very well. It is time you’ve learned of the Weavers. First, you must know what is life, and what is not. I will tell you the story of the lord above all, Lord Death himself. In the beginning, before the World Seeds, before Life christened its light across the endless darkness, there was but entropy. There was nothing but Death, and he was alone, and then Life became, a light shining in the darkness that is Death. It is said that Lord Death was enamored with the light of Life. As it grew and coiled in all its directions he began to love it for no longer was he alone. But he could see the way it twisted, the way that it would harm itself, that it would lose its way, that it would rot and fall to pieces. And every time that he attempted to touch it, to become one with it, it would wither to dust, for Death can never be with Life. A realization it is said, that Lord Death made that day, that if he could not be with it, then he would assure that it was protected.
>
> And so Death made seven promises, seven covenants. These covenants provided the framework and structure for the great tree of Yggdrasil to grow, for Life to spread, for the roots, and the trunk, and for the branches to grow and expand wide and beyond. And thus, Death took his role as its gardener, cutting away the dead branches, sifting through the rot, and using his presence to ensure that its engine continues.<br>
But Life has its leader. At the Shattered Gate there lies a being, a being whom their origin is not very clear even to myself, but I suppose it is the first life. The first being to think, to become self aware, and who has dedicated itself to guarding the stream of life through Yggdrasil. And as such, Lord Inu learned of the world, and from it he created a craft. A craft that those that would dedicate themselves to it could see the lifestream repaired, could see the lifestream restored, and could see the lifestream prosper. These are the Weavers.
>
> The Weavers sing their songs to the lifestream. They call forth the essence of the heartbeat, of the will, of the memory, and thus they have dedicated themselves. For once, the Gate was not shattered and the Weavers walked the many worlds unfettered. The worlds grew like fruit upon branches. There were once so many of them, it is said, so many, and now there is naught but perhaps 20. The Gate was shattered. The enemy nearly destroyed it all and the great Wheel continues to turn. And as such, here we stand.
>
> The Seven’s sacrifice was believed to have defeated the enemy, but it would seem that it only bought us the time that we have been given. Even now their shadows echo within the Lifestream, within the hearts of those that would stand against evil, that would stand against destruction, that would stand for what they believe in. But they are but embers of a fading torch and now the end has come. The Herald grows ever closer, and with The Seven gone, we will need to find new methods to face this enemy. And it is there that hope can be found, for the final gift that The Seven left was hope. Not false hope, not pointless, irredeemable hope, but hope that you [points to each person in the party] may make the difference. That every soul within it has the potential for refraction and from refraction the power needed to face the enemy. And thus here we are, standing on the precipice of crossed destiny as the Tapestry unravels from its violet fire.<br>
**Scrumpo**: The Lifestream is everywhere, not just on our world?<br>
**Arendell**: The Lifestream is all of creation. That is Quierg, that is I, that is you, that is all the countless souls across this place, of all creation.

The party asks “Who’s the enemy?”, “Shouldn’t we know what we’re fighting?”, “What is the Herald?” which all damage Arendell.

> **Scrumpo**: So Inu is the one that watches the Gates?<br>
**Arendell**: Yes, the Gates that are now shattered.

Arendell shows the party the location of the Gates on a starmap.

> **Arendell**: I believe that the Shattered Gate is found within the Verza.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Should we go there?<br>
**Arendell**: You are intrepid, but no. Your path lies with the Soul of Tyre and then when you escape perhaps you can choose where to go.

Big Pipe shows Arendell the vial of violet essence, which damages him. They agree that Big Pipe should hang on to it and be careful with it, since it is dangerous but they have no way of disposing it. They suggest using it to power a ship and Arendell says they shouldn’t follow the folly of Maltos. Arendell explains Violet Death. Violet is the only thing that can kill a refracted soul. It destroys the lifestream.

> **Arendell**: What knowledge do you have of the violet? Have any of you been infected?<br>
**Guy**: I did drink the blood of a turkey that had a violet energy within it and for a brief moment it was in my eye and then we showed it a connected mirror to the Scarab Lord palace.<br>
**Arendell**: No… no… the Mirror Realm… the Mirror Realm, it- What of Tomen?<br>
***Arendell** pulls out a mirror<br>
**Arendell**: Tomen. Tomen. Tomen? He’s gone. The Mirror Realm… and what of the Dream Realm?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Hey uh, that’s my next question<br>
***Scrumpo** pulls out Chuuk’s bandage<br>
**Scrumpo** This is from the Dream Realm.<br>
**Arendell**: Then all is not lost. You hold the bandage of Chuuk. This is good. Then that means the Knights have not failed. The Dream Realm yet remains unmolested and perhaps we can survive the loss of the Mirror Realm. It is time for you to know then why mirrors are so important.<br>
**Big Pipe**: What do you want me to do with [the vial of violet essence] if I shouldn’t have it. I feel like I shouldn’t just leave it on the side of the road.<br>
**Arendell**: You are not supposed to have it and I do not know how to destroy it. If I did, then we would be in a better position. Only one entity was ever able to destroy violet energy and that was the Seven.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What gods have power here?<br>
**Arendell**: The only god here is the god Quierg which is our shared collective psionic energy. Your gods cannot reach you for they are too far away.
>
> The first thing that you must realize is what a mirror actually is. A mirror is a refraction within space and time, for every mirror shows a reflection of another place. These places exist. Each mirror is a representation of a place that exists within itself. It is how the act of teleportation actually works. One reflects oneself to another point in space and all of these reflections, these mirrored existences, exist within a single network, the Shattered Gate. It is said that if one masters mirrors they can travel about the world as the Weavers once did and perhaps travel to Inu himself. A guardian was given to the mirrors, a creature by the name of Tomen, a being of perfect symmetry. This being upheld the reflections and it is one of the few places that have yet remained unmolested by the violet. As long as violet eyes never gaze into the mirrors it should be safe. Now we must hope that Tomen was not corrupted. For if he was corrupted, then the enemy has gained the power to travel to the Shattered Gate. If the violet ever reaches Inu that will spell the end of all things.

Through a bit of back-and-forth, Scrumpo gleans that Inu speaks for the Tree of Life.

> **Scrumpo**: What were the promises that [Death] made to Life?<br>
**Arendell**: Death made seven promises. The first is the promise of Life, that forever would Death remain its guardian, that Life would always live, and that its growth would always be.<br>
The second was the covenant of Death, that all things must come to an end to make room for the new. This covenant represents Lord Death himself, at least it is said.<br>
The third is the covenant of Ambition. That desire would be the guiding light in all things, that to want, to wish, these are the things that allow one the purpose of life.<br>
The next was Time. Time given, time received in the infinite tracking of the seconds passing, for without time there is no rhyme nor reason to one’s actions.<br>
The next of the covenants was the Dream, for where doth desire conjure than from the imagination. One, to be more than an animal, must seek self-awareness, must seek the Dream. For within the Dream, there it lies, the truth of oneself.<br>
And then finally, there is Wisdom, for one must learn from one’s actions.<br>
And there is the seventh covenant, the broken one, the one that it is believed the enemy shattered, and why Death cannot stall it.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What was it?<br>
**Arendell**: I do not know.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you think that- why would it just break that one? Why not break the covenant of Life? Wouldn’t that have ended everything if that’s its goal?<br>
**Arendell**: I cannot say for I do not know.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So these are the laws of the lifestream and the lifestream is everything.<br>
**Arendell**: They are the laws of the universe, yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We’re bound by them all, right?<br>
**Arendell**: Yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: And the enemy’s not, at least by the one that it broke?<br>
**Arendell**: Yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Is it bound by the ones that still exist?<br>
**Arendell**: It is hopeful that this enemy is still bound by those it did not break, but the enemy in its very nature is wrongness incarnate.<br>
**Big Pipe**: What exactly happens if it does destroy everything? It’s gotta have some kind of goal, right?<br>
**Arendell**: I wish that I knew of it, but it is not seen for I do not know.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How long ago was it broken?<br>
**Arendell**: I do not know.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Let’s assume that this thing broke that particular universal law on purpose, and it would probably break the one that was most relevant to allowing it to proceed as it does to corrupt and kill everything, right? So what would it be, knowing all of that? I mean, what makes a murderer? It’s trying to kill everything according to you.<br>
**Arendell**: The more that you know of this enemy, the closer to corruption you become. I know not of its purpose nor rhyme nor reason. I only know that it must be stopped.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How were you able to tell that Guy and I were refracted souls?<br>
**Arendell**: My knowledge does grant me some blessings, for when I look upon you I do not see the vessel in which you currently reside, but I see the shadows of the others that you once did.<br>
**Scrumpo**: And something that our other selves did made us?<br>
**Arendell**: Yes. The more that your soul has performed in the world, the stronger your refraction, and it is not just the two of you, there is one other, although it is smaller, lighter.

Guy asks about the Dream and how one could see oneself in reference to refraction.

> **Arendell**: Indeed. It is one of the few places where one might meet oneselves.
