# Shattered Crowns -- Season 02 - Session 01

Aired: 

## Relavent Lore

The session begins when the group takes their boat and ventures into an opening to the bowels of Quierg which is described as a "festering organ" with "evidence of rot and sickness".

Upon entering the area, the party notices rancid viscera (cancer) that slowly drips onto the floor of the flesh, as well as shadows moving through the walls of Quierg’s intestines.

After the party explores a bit, Big Pipe utilizes his Arcane Eye ability to cautiously traverse the intestines of Quierg until Bronchial notices the Arcane Eye and appears before it.

### Arcane Eye is Discovered:

> **Arcadum**: As you turn the Arcane Eye to go look, it stops, as if it’s stuck. Alright gentlemen.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: I don’t...I don’t like that.

> **Bronchial**: A curious little spy within my domain, groans, Where is your master, implement?<br>

> **Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Can I speak through the eye?<br>
**Arcadum**: No you can’t; and something walks around the corner here, holding up it’s hand magically ensnaring the eye, and you see this: Bronchial appears.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Oh, nice. I think we found the source of the cancer, or at least one of them. While it is doing this thing I am going to try and mark down the coordinates, fuck. I know EXACTLY where this is.

> **Bronchial**: Let us see where you are.<br>

> **Arcadum**: You will feel the Arcane Eye reverse.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Uh oh.<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Can we visually see something is happening to him?<br>
**Arcadum**: You do because Big Pipe starts to sweat and kind of twitch and panic.<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: I’m going to hit Big Pipe as a reaction.<br>
**Arcadum**: Thankfully the connection is severed.<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: HE KNOWS THOUGH.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Was the connection severed before he could see our location?<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, Big Pipe awakens.

> **Big Pipe**: Catches his breath<br>
**Huck**: Whoa, you okay there pardner?<br>
**Big Pipe**: Who hit me?<br>
**Scrumpo**: No one :)<br>

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Scrumpo looks like he was about to hit you, though.<br>
***MoonMoon (Scrumpo)** laughs.

> **Scrumpo**: Sorry man, it looked like you were freaking out, needed to snapped out, break your concentration.<br>
**Big Pipe**: You needed to, something knows we’re here.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Nice.<br>
**Huck**: Well somethin, can you be a lil more specific?<br>
**Big Pipe**: Whatever’s, I imagine the source of this stuff, knows we’re here. We should be in a different location then where we currently are.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What’s that?<br>
***Bronchial** starts to appear.<br>
**Big Pipe**: We should go.<br>

> **Ster (Guy)**: Can I walk over it?<br>
**Arcadum**: Welp no need to because you see this.

### Bronchial Appears

> ***Bronchial** arrives.<br>

> **Arcadum**: High level spellcasting, high level enemies.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: I give him a wave.<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will look at you with sort of a passing gaze of disinterest, but a quiet curiosity. I need you all to make me religion checks.

(They make the checks, Big Pipe and Scrumpo get high rolls.)

> **Arcadum**: This is a very rare form of undead, and one I do not get to use very often. I am a little excited<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: It’s a Lich!<br>
**Arcadum**: It is not a Lich, but a Mohrg. A Mohrg is a skeleton-kind-of-creature that is composed of living flesh that etches in and out, but more specifically they are formed only by the violation of the transference of soul energy. Meaning at the moment of birth a necromantic rite is performed and a Mohrg is born instead of a child.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: All I know about these, is that you just don’t fuck with them, you just don’t fuck with em. Does my character know not to fuck with him?

(The party spends a moment talking about him)

> **Guy**: Hello, I don’t see anything wrong with this, he’s friendly right?<br>
**Bronchial**: It would seem, we have things to discuss, interlopers. First, introductions are in order, I am Bronchial, the False Saint, (Token says Cancerous Lord) lord of these lands.<br>
**Huck**: Uh well, howdy, my name’s Huckleberry, my friends call me Huck, um, we’re just a regular band of adventurers trying to escape back to our land, we don’t mean you any harm.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Hold on. Hey what are you doin here?<br>
**Guy**: He said he rules these lands.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah, since when and for how long, and who are you ruling over?<br>
**Bronchial**: My children, of course.<br>
**Ikkar**: Right, the things in the walls.
**Bronchial**: You see, tis but a matter of time before all of this creature is mine.<br>
***Bronchial** makes ungodly noises.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Listen ChokesMcGee, alright, you might think that this whale belongs to you, but there’s something way worse that’s going to consume all of this.<br>
**Bronchial**: (*grunts*) It speaks in foreboding words, but no deceptions. Interest gained, speak the words you seek.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Why don’t we make a trade then?<br>
**Bronchial**: Trade? What value trade?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Knowledge.<br>
**Bronchial**: Hmm, and what do you wish in exchange?<br>
**Scrumpo**: My uh, my metallic friend found some interesting things in the depths here, and we might trade for those, and exchange for free passage.<br>
**Bronchial**: Specificity.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Alright listen up man, why don’t we talk about each other first, you know, like we just got here on Quierg, but how long have you been here?<br>
**Bronchial**: Longer than your lifespan.<br>
**Scrumpo**: And you’ve just been biding your time down here?
**Bronchial**: Biding, no no, growing, claiming, birthing.
**Scrumpo**: Are you, uh probably not, are you native to this place.
**Bronchial**: This one has few memories of before the flesh. This one is unsure of the answer to your question.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Are you interested in finding out?<br>
**Bronchial**: Not necessary, irrelevant. Power, prestige, domination, is mine.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Have you made any forays into the surface in order to, you know, assimilate?<br>
**Bronchial**: I have sent my children to eat, to feast. I can sense the blood of one of my children on you.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Oh...Wait have you been to the teeth?<br>
**Bronchial**: Yessss.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Okay, we did that, but it attacked us, we had no idea.<br>
**Bronchial**: (*laughs*) I bear no sympathy for the weak child that is dead. Your apologies are misplaced, but appreciated.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah, look man I hate to break it to you, but you’re living in a bubble, all of this. We’ve been from the outside, I know your reach extends to the insides of this whale, but we are from a different planet.<br>
**Bronchial**: This one is aware, this one has assimilated many from across the sea of stars.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So you know what’s coming then?<br>
**Bronchial**: This one does not know what you speak of.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look, I know that it’s probably your most profound desire to dominate and assimilate and devour, but at the end of the day, you’re going to get wiped out from existence and all of us are going to get wiped from existence too if we don’t act. You won’t-<br>
**Bronchial**:  Again, it threatens with foreboding but provides no information. If thou wish to trade, then we trade. No more time wasted.<br>
**Guy**: Hold on, Scrumpo. Let’s think outside the box here for a moment. If the entire council is corrupted wouldn’t it be a better thing if we were to allow this creature to overtake the whole whale?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah, about that, what do you know about the keepers?<br>
**Bronchial**: They aren’t my children, they whisper to the great whale they are the medicine (*laughs*), they try, (*laughs*), the last keeper, (???),  skull. <br>
**Scrumpo**: Mr. Bronchial they are not the medicine, they are worse than you.<br>
**Bronchial**: Explain.<br>
**Scrumpo**:  They are being controlled by the thing we’re talking about, the thing that threatens all existence. They’re our enemy too.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, persuasion checks.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Can I do an insight to see if it plans on fulfilling it’s trade or if it’s just going to kill us after? Would that be insight?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Alright I’m gonna do an insight.<br>

(Rolls insight: `16`)

> **Arcadum**: Pipe, you get a feeling this creature will do what it wants and is not beholden to anything, not even it’s word, but that doesn’t mean it won’t do it.

(Guy rolls high for the persuasion check)

> **Guy**: Well, we know what we want, there’s a few machines down here I don’t think you’ll find of any use. So, we’re simply trying to leave and we think we understand what you want and we don’t like the people running this place. So, if we could even help you kill those keepers, I suppose we could have a mutually beneficial partnership here.<br>
**Bronchial**: You wish for the metal?<br>
**Guy**: Yes, yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: To clarify, sorry, there’s like four different things down here we need.<br>
**Bronchial**: You take the metal, the wound opens. My children go through it and reach surface, good. You can take as much as you want.<br>
**Scrumpo**: When you say the metal, do you mean the giant vessel that was behind you?<br>
**Bronchial**: Any that you find, do take, you take, trade, tell what COMES.<br>
**Guy**: Who wants to handle this one?<br>
**Big Pipe**: I’ll handle it, I’ll field this question.

(rolls low persuasion)

They talk about not actually saying the names of the enemies for a moment.

> **Big Pipe**: What comes for this whale and what comes for what seems like all of us, over the course of time is a great and terrible power that seems to corrupt and completely destroy anything that it touches.<br>
***Bronchial** laughs.<br>
**Bronchial**: You describe cancer.<br>
**Big Pipe**: It’s worse than that.<br>
**Bronchial**: Worse?<br>
**Big Pipe**: Worse.<br>

> **Arcadum**: The creature will get very close to your face and then say:

> **Bronchial**: Explain.<br>
**Guy**:  There is only one that can control this cancer, and it is none of us, it is no one, it is one being that wishes to destroy everything.<br>

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: While Guy is talking, can I gesture to move kind of like, over here, like made a lil like nod of my head to get em to inch over here to surround them.

They talk about doing this.

> **Bronchial**: What is it’s name?<br>
**Guy**: When you speak it’s name, it gets stronger, but uh, are you perhaps familiar with, I don’t know people around here...there are rumors we heard up top of violet energy?<br>
**Bronchial**: You speak of the...ohhh.<br>
***Bronchial** groans and laughs.<br>
**Bronchial**: Good good, Bronchial will keep his word after all.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What do you mean?

> **Arcadum**: Bronchial will raise his hands and will go:

> **Bronchial**: Come with me.

### Bronchial’s Domain

The party gets teleported to where Bronchial spotted Big Pipe’s Arcane Eye and they talk about how they might be in a different pickle.

> **Bronchial**: (*laughs*) Bronchial keep his word.

> **Arcadum**: Bronchial will shove his hand into this mucus, like, disgusting orb of cancer and will pull out a strange symbol, which he will put around his neck. He will then turn and will enter a meditative stance. You will see that the symbol is that of a green triangle radiating with power.

> **Bronchial**: I, Bronchial one of the sworn, one of the many, Bronchial will keep his word. You speak of violet, you speak of what is to come, Bronchial knows, Bronchial will help, and then Bronchial is released of what he promised.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What did you promise?<br>
**Bronchial**: Service.<br>
**Scrumpo**: To who?<br>
**Bronchial**: To the Cardinal.

The party notes this.

> **Scrumpo**: What was he having you try to accomplish?<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial was bound with the other two, Archons of Rot and Decay. The Cardinal begged us to keep safe the tri of the rot<br>
**Scrumpo**: And when you say the rot you mean the stuff that’s affecting Quierg?<br>
***Bronchial** laughs<br>
**Scrumpo**: Where are the other two?<br>
**Bronchial**: They wait in their homes for what is to come.<br>
**Scrumpo**: On the surface?<br>
**Bronchial**: No, not here. Not on rotted one, dying whale, no. They wait in their domains for the time when we are called, and you are the calling.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Are you going to contact them after we’re through here?<br>
**Bronchial**: Already they have been.<br>

> **Arcadum**: He will gesture towards the triangle.

> **Bronchial**: The other colors prepare what is to come, we will do our duty.<br>
**Scrumpo**: And your duty is to destroy the violet?<br>
**Bronchial**: (*laughs*) No.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What is it?<br>
***Bronchial** sounds pained<br>
**Bronchial**: To help you destroy the violet.<br>

(Scrumpo insight checks him)

> **Arcadum**: Your insight reveals this creature is not trying to deceive you, or at least it doesn’t appear to be. Possibly because it doesn't think it has to.

> **Scrumpo**: So just for posterities’ sake, you say your mission, along with these two is to assist us in destroying the violet?<br>
**Bronchial**: It is the binding of the colors, the covenants refract a prism.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Okay, look, I guess we’re friends then.<br>
**Bronchial**: laughs<br>
**Bronchial**: No, friends no.<br>
***Bronchial** laughs again.
**Guy**: No, yes on a personal note I am quite intrigued with you really, what exactly are you?<br>
**Bronchial**: Mohrg.<br>
**Guy**: Mohrg? Hmm.<br>
**Bronchial**:  (?) of flesh and rot. Now Bronchial will keep his word. Bronchial will help you get the metals you need. Bronchial will see that you complete your journey. Bronchial will finally be able to be free of his duty.<br>
**Scrumpo**: One more thing, can you tell us more about the Cardinal?<br>
**Bronchial**: The Cardinal is many in one- the seven pieces require the standing one. That which is found the Cardinal keeps safe, the Cardinal is guide, the Cardinal is-

> **Arcadum**: You can see it’s struggling to tell you.

> **Bronchial**: The Cardinal can know without the cost of knowledge.<br>
**Scrumpo**: When was the last time you saw him?<br>
**Bronchial**: This one saw the Cardinal when it squirmed into it’s skull. It took this one and it held it in it’s arms and hand. It smiled it said, you will have purpose, you must keep safe, the green tri. This Bronchial remembers, the face was kind of the Cardinal, it’s hands were like wolves of white and black.

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Well we know what that is because we saw that.

> **Scrumpo**: He’s talking about the guy that helped us against that giant beast in the Dream. It looks like we’ve been allies for longer than it seems. Look, I have to admit, first impression you’re kind of off putting my man.<br>
**Guy**: Oh excuse me, they are all very racist, they wouldn’t let me have an undead lab.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I’m just saying I’m surprised we reached this common ground.<br>
**Bronchial**: Do not care what think of me, Bronchial keep his word. Word has been kept.<br>
**Huck**: Excuse me if I may, Bronchial, mind if I call you Kyle? So Kyle my question is, after you taken over Quierg, what do you plan to do? What comes next?<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial will make word of his own.<br>
**Huck**: Okay...Meaning?<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial will take flesh of the whale and will graft it into a perfect place where all might live.<br>
**Guy**: Sounds beautiful!<br>
**Huck**: Ok…<br>
**Scrumpo**: Hey, we met the guy that held you in his arms in the Dream, do you know what the Dream is?<br>
**Bronchial**: You saw the Cardinal?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah.<br>
**Bronchial**: Where is the Cardinal?<br>
**Scrumpo**: He fought alongside us in the Dream. He came from what seemed like a different path, another part of the dream and was gone after the thing was defeated.<br>
**Bronchial**: Gone? Where?<br>
**Scrumpo**: He did not die, I don’t know where he went.<br>
**Guy**: Well, I believe I have a part of the Cardinal in this sword.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah I was gonna say, show him his dad.

> **Arcadum**: You offer him the blade, he’ll take it. Bronchial will drop the sword as if it hurts him.

> **Bronchial**: I feel close to blade, cut into Bronchial.<br>
**Guy**: Oh dear, sorry, we don’t know much about it, it’s all prophetic, and I’m having weird dreams all the time, very, very hard to sleep these days.<br>
**Scrumpo**: My point is, is you say that this guy with the wolf arms raised you right, or at least birthed you.<br>
**Bronchial**: No, found when small, put in skull, given purpose. Could have killed Bronchial, but put Bronchial into soiled flesh, where Bronchial could grow strong. Bronchial is thankful to the Cardinal, so Bronchial will keep his word.

### The Foreboding Fate of Quierg

> **Scrumpo**: And he said you need to keep the rot safe right?<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial must stand with the other two and keep safe the tri of green, the rot and the death.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I think what he intended is that you fight the violet presence here on Quierg, not consume the whole planet and turn it into whatever it is you want.<br>
**Bronchial**: No, this one does not fight the violet, that is what you do.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yes, but you can help us, you don’t have to sit by-<br>
**Guy**: He is helping us.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah but I mean, there’s a whole institution on this planet that is being run by someone corrupted by the violet, we know that now.<br>
**Guy**: Yeah, he’s going to turn the whale into a planet so they’ll all be dead.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Well he doesn’t have to do that, the person who saved him probably didn’t intend for that to happen.<br>
**Guy**: I don’t know, this all seems quite preplanned.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Well, he’s a Cardinal, he is knee deep in the violet stuff. He said to keep the rot safe so that there would be a safeguard against the violet on Quierg. So you can destroy the violet presence and fulfill your purpose.

> **Arcadum**: Perception check.

They discuss this for a moment

> **Bronchial**: struggling The sense make, mind make, mind stack...Fine this one will...Bronchial will kill keeper then.<br>
**Scrumpo**: It’s the arch keeper.<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial will kill all of them.<br>
**Scrumpo**: That’s probably a safe bet, everyone that is associated with the keeper institution, the university here needs to go.<br>
**Guy**: I noticed you teleported here, you want to teleport and do it together?<br>
**Bronchial**: No, you must take purpose.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look, we helped you realize the true purpose of what it is your saviour intended for you, but can you please promise us you won’t kill everyone else on this planet after we’re gone?.<br>
**Bronchial**: Promises, promises, promises. Bronchial keep one promise, make another. Fine, Bronchial...the people...the peoples above’s lives, but Bronchial will make new world. They may live then.<br>
**Scrumpo**: That’s fine, the world that they’re on right now is pretty screwed, the violet runs deep. You need to be the one that strengthens it and rebirths it into something that they can actually live on.<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial will make them strong. Bronchial will make them more.<br>
**Scrumpo**: (*nods*) You’re not half bad.<br>

### Getting the Bandian Vessel Parts

> **Bronchial**: What need? Tell Bronchial.<br>
**Ikkar**: Sorry?<br>
**Bronchial**: What need? Tell Bronchial.

Bahroo tries to describe IC what they want, but struggles to describe high tech items in a medieval context. Bronchial grunts in anger.

> **Arcadum**: He’ll walk up and slap a tentacle right into your fuckin head.

> **Bronchial**: Bronchial see.

> ***Arcadum**: snaps<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, it will summon all three of the pieces and will deposit them on the ground here, including the mirror.

> **Bronchial**: Take. Leave.<br>
**Guy**: Hold on, were there other people here? We noticed boats.<br>
**Bronchial**:  (*laughs*) There were.<br>
**Guy**: What is that all about, how did they even end up here?<br>
**Bronchial**: The whale eat.<br>
**Guy**: The whale ate a boat?<br>
**Bronchial**: Yes. Some come from through the mirror.<br>
**Scrumpo**: They all come from the mirror?<br>
**Bronchial**: Some did. One came here on own.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Who?<br>
**Bronchial**: Not sure, some lady. Could not eat her

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Yeah, Scrumpo would have no fucking idea based on the stuff Big Pipe described to us.

> **Guy**: Alright, mind if we take a look at this big thing and be on our way?<br>
**Bronchial**: Fine. Wait.<br>
***Bronchial** pukes.

> **Arcadum**: He will vomit up a flesh sack. He will hand it to Scrumpo

> **Scrumpo**: What’s this?<br>
**Bronchial**: Take, keep close. If you see other green tri, use to make not die.

The party thanks Bronchial and reaffirms to kill the keepers but not the other denizens of Quierg.

> **Bronchial**: This one has made it’s promise. Go in your little vessel and then go.
***Big Pipe** simply looks over his shoulder and looks at the giant crystal<br>
**Big Pipe**: You need that?<br>
**Bronchial**: Yes.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, he’s going to move past you and start draining mana out of it. Casting more cancer spell.

> **Ikkar**: Are there more of these on Quierg?<br>
**Bronchial**: Yes.<br>
**Ikkar**: Do you know how someone might, you know, take a chip off them without blowing themselves up?

> **Arcadum**: (*chink*) He’ll hand you a piece.

> **Ikkar**: That was very simple. I mean normally, you don’t know us very well, normally it’s quite cataclysmic, we tend to; you know what nevermind. It’s better we don’t tell him about it.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Please sir may I get a crumb of crystal?<br>
**Bronchial**: No.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Ok.<br>
**Huck**: Kyle, you take care of yourself, alright be well.<br>
**Bronchial**: Wait, wait. You come back. You come back.<br>
***Huck** will sort of, uneasily trod over.<br>
**Bronchial**: You, kind to Bronchial.<br>
**Huck**: Uh, yeah you didn’t kill us and you seem to be helpin us, so I appreciate it.<br>
**Bronchial**: Bronchial fix.<br>
**Huck**: Fix? Whaddaya mean fix?

> **Arcadum**: He’ll take your hat, Bronchial will go noises and will make a fleshy hat plop and will then hand you back your other hat.<br>
**Octo (Huck)**: Is it like, wet on my head?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah.

> **Huck**: Uhh, I’ve always wanted a hat like this thank you. Uh thanks, take care pardner, don’t work too hard.

The group spends time discussing coming back to check on Bronchial and Quierg after their quest is over.

> ***Scrumpo** investigates the ship.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you investigate the ship, you notice, first of all it’s completely tattered. Wrecked, pulled open. There’s nothing to go inside, it’s smashed against the flesh, almost as if it has flown through an open wound that it maybe perhaps had made. But there is one thing you find. You find a single red, sort of, almost horned sigil made out of a red metal, glowing blinking red light.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Can I arcana check it?<br>
**Arcadum**: No arcana check will be possible this time, this is beyond you.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Then I’m going to grab it with my metal hand.<br>
**Arcadum**: You pick it up, and as soon as you do, your suit will begin to react and will go mechanical noises.

> **Faulty**: Vestments acquired, preparing manifest, return to vessel.<br>

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Does he look like he’s about to teleport?<br>
**Arcadum**: Who?<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Big Pipe.<br>
**Arcadum**: No.

They discuss the sounds Arcadum made and the party talks some more.

> **Ster (Guy)**: Is there any symbology on the ship?<br>
**Arcadum**: There is, but you don’t recognize it.<br>
**Ster (Guy)**: Can you describe it?<br>
**Arcadum**: I can, hold on I gotta be careful with this. Oh shit, that’s right. You see a six pointed star inlaid with red in the symbology on the ship.<br>
**Ster (Guy)**: Sick.<br>
**Joe (Ikkar)**: That doesn’t look like the red star that we saw on Amber lady’s belt right?<br>
**Arcadum**: It actually does, and now that you mention that you also remember seeing the green triangle on her belt.<br>
**Joe (Ikkar)**: I doo.

### OOC Discussion:

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Ohhhh. You know what’s fucked up? We are literally doing- we just Seven'd what we just did. We literally Seven'd this whole mission, dude.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Taking the lesser of two evils and goin', "ah fuck it."<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Yes, exactly dude, that is what just happened.<br>
**Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Well, the other option on Seven route would be to fight Bronchial, which I don’t think we can take him.<br>
**Ster (Guy)**: Does Scrumpo understand the concept of, like, balancing good and evil?<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Uhh, I would say that after the refracting and everything that happened that Scrumpo leans good, so he gets it, but-<br>
**Ster (Guy)**: But does he get that if everything was good that things would be unbalanced and it would be bad?<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Well, it’s not a matter of balance, it’s just a matter of perspective. We’re going to get philosophical at this point. Like why does it literally have to be 50/50 good and evil for there to be some sort of metaphysical balance that even matters to begin with, you know.<br>
**Ster (Guy)**: I was just curious if he had any thought on it or which way he leaned on that.<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Well if we were to discuss that in character Scrumpo would basically be like, he probably doesn’t think there needs to be a balance. It’s too abstract to be like, you know I need to do a good deed and then a bad deed for some sort of weird karmic thing to be in balance, you know.

### Leaving Bronchial to His Work

The party discusses getting the other items they found.

> **Big Pipe**: Sir Bronchial?<br>
***Bronchial**: grunts in disgust<br>
**Big Pipe**: While I was investigating this place, I noticed a area that was basically covered in the cancer, was that also your doing?<br>
**Bronchial**: Yes.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Where does that lead to?<br>
**Bronchial**: Here.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Follow up question, uhh, we found a room with barrels and treasure. Are you okay with us going in there, is it dangerous?<br>
**Bronchial**: (*laughs*) No take, cursed<br>
**Scrumpo**: Okay, what about that Faewild axe?<br>
**Bronchial**: Ugh, gross. You have. Ugh, here.<br>

> **Arcadum**: He’ll conjure it for you.

> **Scrumpo**: One other thing, the uh-<br>
**Bronchial**: UGH.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Sorry, the rose of Viderick.<br>
**Bronchial**: What?<br>
**Scrumpo**: It’s the rose on the longboat.

> **Arcadum**: He’ll kinda just tilt his head like he doesn’t know what the fuck you just said.

> **Scrumpo**: Okay a rose is like a flower, it’s got a green-<br>
***Bronchial**: grunts in displeasure.<br>

Everyone laughs at Kyle’s torment and Bronchial teleports around his domain to retrieve the flower of Viderick and the Faewild axe.

> **Bronchial**: Here.<br>
***Bronchial** throws the items at the party.<br>
***Scrumpo** will take it and hand it to Ikkar.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What do you think big guy?<br>
***Ikkar** is going to take a look.

(Ikkar rolls low on a religion check)

> **Bahroo (Big Pipe)**: Big Pipe will also take a look and do a religion check on the flower.<br>
**Arcadum**: That is a rose of Viderick, it is the holy symbol of the God of love and loss. That’s it, it’s just a holy symbol.<br>
**MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Does it look like it was made by like, an actual cleric of Viderick.<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah. It probably belonged to one.

> **Scrumpo**: We can return this to somebody on Kalkatesh when we get back.<br>
**Ikkar**: Or impress a girl.<br>
**Guy**: It doesn’t work that way, it’s all just pretend.<br>
**Bronchial**: (*sounds of increasing ire*) What else want?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Oh, can you teleport us back to our gondola up above? I just want to get out of your hair so you can get back to work, ok? Otherwise we’re gonna have to walk.

The party thanks Bronchial as he teleports them back to their boat. Bahroo and Arcadum talk about how they completed the dungeon.

> **MoonMoon (Scrumpo)**: Can we roll to see if this axe is magical?<br>
**Arcadum**: It isn’t.<br>
**Octo (Huck)**: Does my hat do anything different or is it just a flesh hat now?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is just a creepy flesh hat. It is however alive and feeds off of sunlight.

They talk about the hat and Arcadum’s excitement for voicing Bronchial. Moon clarifies that the Bandian vessel is a ship and they talk about the final session next week.
