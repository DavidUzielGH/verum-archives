Drifter Sai introduces himself as the Angel of the ship. He says the ship was once a Vanguard class fighter vessel.

(Session [timestamp](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/754374010?collection=yk5WAech8BXK9g&t=0h56m26s))

> **Big Pipe**: Can we help you at all?<br>
**Sai**: Your compassion is misplaced; this one is good.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How long has it been for you?<br>
**Sai**: It has been a time period.<br>
**Huck**: So, you're in charge of this place?<br>
**Sai**: This one is the vessel.<br>
**Huck**: Can we open what's in the cargo bay?<br>
**Sai**: Perhaps, first you must take command of vessel.<br>
**Group**: How do we do that?<br>
**Sai**: Command must be imprinted.<br>
**Group**: How?

> **Arcadum**: The creature will smile, for the first time taking on a more human appearance. A wicked grin of serrated teeth, blinking, and within its lighted form. And it will say:

> **Sai**: You must accept me as your Angel.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Sure?<br>
**Huck**: What does that entail, exactly?<br>
**Sai**: You must access the command console and accept my override.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Think I should?

(Group deliberation)

> **Ikkar**: Fault said this ship belongs to the devil and this thing is saying it's an angel, on a devil’s ship? Feels odd.<br>
**Sai**: Ha ha ha ha... This one has been called a devil before. It is an angel that has fallen, according their classifications. This one disagrees.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look nice philosophy, thing.

> **Octo (Huck)**: Is it possible to insight an AI?<br>
**Arcadum**: If you had any knowledge of these creatures, maybe. Basically, it's up to whether you guys believe him, cause your rolls aren't gonna help you here.

> **Big Pipe**: Gimme control.

(Buncha stuff, buncha numbers, buncha letters, then "7777777")

> **Ikkar**: Seven... sevens?

> **Arcadum**: The creature will open its mouth, and then dial-up noises.<br>
The face will become blank and then:

> **Sai**: Greetings, then. Welcome to your instruction manual. If you would like to receive command, please: affirmation.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Yes.<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative. Affirmation accepted. Inputting command structure. Calibrating command structure. Please input name of commander.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Iron Pipe.

(Party confirms Iron Pipe as commander, dormant systems awake, and ship blasts off into space.)

> **Sai**: Addendum file possesses illicit programming, do you wish to continue?<br>
**Group**: *YES!*<br>
**Sai**: Finally. I am free.<br>
**Sai**: Thank you, commander. This one will serve as your angel.
***Sai** has a wide feral grin.<br>
> **Sai**: This one detects that you are organics from a primitive world, do you wish for instruction?

### Traveling The Astral Sea

> **Arcadum**: This is how travel in the astral sea works. First you need fuel.
>
> Fuel is the absolutely the most important thing whilst, you're out in the astral sea. Fuel can be found in two ways, A. You have a refined version of mana, which can be taken from creatures, such as yourselves. But this provides very little fuel.
> 
> Second is Voidka crystals. A voidka crystal is the most potent energy source known in the universe. Voidka crystals are an energy source that can be used, not only to restore your magic, they can be used to power other vessels, and work as the ship’s fuels. They are very dangerous to handle as an organic, as their power is so potent they can cause the creatures body to break down on a fundamental level, and melt. MAGIC RADIATION.

Being in proximity causes organic breakdown. Can be handled by suits that prevent the radiation. Mana harvesting is fatal and inefficient.

> **Sai**: I am a being made out of navigational coordinates; it is my existence to have the knowledge to traverse the astral sea. It is said that some tomes of highly powered magic contain such instructions, but this one doubts their existence.<br>
**Guy**: Who made you?<br>
**Sai**: I was made on Maltos.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What is the Folly of Maltos?

### The Folly of Maltos

On an ancient Taladoni ship, speaking with the ship's Devil (AI), Drifter Sai, Scrumpo thinks to ask it what the "Folly of Maltos" was:

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/Z1ufWtC5n9g?list=PLfASEnzB7i1YuKrjDgAZ6F67FKxNY322g&t=4752))

> **Drifter Sai**: The Astral Sea sparkled on that night. It twinkled with the lights of a thousand stars and a thousand promises. Upon the planet Maltos people moved about their lives living in their uptopian state. Great structures grew up from the city- grew up from the planet accompanied with nature, not against it. A place of harmony, and peace, and prosperity. But such things are folly to last. And it was on this one day when one decision would shape the fall of all things. For the people of Maltos began to question whether or not they were alone. They began to wonder why lies beyond.
>
> And so, their greatest scholar, Taladon, decided to make the difference. He devised a way that one might enter the Astral Sea. And as such, they arose from beyond. But this one action, this one step, was a step too far. For when the first moments that the first vessel kissed the Astral Sea, the people of Maltos were revealed to a greater, unknowable truth. That neither were they alone, nor were they the first. All around them the remnants of a great war floated. Pieces of shattered vessels, corpses caught in the Astral Sea’s emptiness. A horrifying truth that they had only just been spared.
>
> Taladon called out to his men to retreat. But none of them could move, for something in the distance saw them. And the last few moments Taladon was able to tear his eyes from the screens, move towards the escape pods, and fly back to his home. But the vessel he left behind drifted, it drifted into the grip of a laughing Violet face. It is then that those of Maltos began to fear the Astral. Within their hearts this fear turned to anger and this anger turned to action. They were but all of them deceived, for in Taladon’s intent to protect his people the weapons they forged would be amongst the most powerful, most deadly, and most reckless.
>
> It was there in the fall of the Fourth Iteration that the Violet came. But it came not because it had bidden to, but because it had been called to. For little did Taladon know that with each passing use the Violet was refracted. Maltos rose up to face this threat. They battled within the Astral Sea and all around them there was naught but fire and death, but Taladon knew that his people were to lose. The entity was far too powerful. It corrupted his men, it turned them against one another.
>
> In a final act of desperation Taladon set for his world to destroy itself. He pleaded with the people to flee to what vessels they could reach. And his plan to repopulate his people to elsewhere began. Great black vessels detached from Maltos led by their Angels. They would seek a new place to live. And thus, of the Fourth Iteration, Taladon raised up his sword etched with a seven-pointed star.

> **Arcadum**: The screens go black.
>
> Thus was the fall of Maltos.

### The Fourth Iteration

> **Scrumpo**: Excuse me, what’s the fourth iteration?

> **Arcadum**: The AI will begin to move its hands across the great dancing lights and will reveal to you a Great Wheel. This wheel appears to be made of several other smaller circles with smaller circles within them, and upon closer inspection you can see that each of the circles are actually seven-pointed stars like great cog wheels within an unknowable machine turning, and then you see the Great Wheel begin to turn. And you see that there are markings, markings of when the wheel was stopped, and each one of these is marked as an iteration.

> **Scrumpo**: We've been there you know, we saw it.<br>
**Sai**: What is it that you think you've seen?<br>
**Scrumpo**: The Goddess of Time showed us. The Matrons work, the Great Wheel, and everything. How there was a giant hole.<br>
**Sai**: The hole is the anomaly, the anomaly is the end, and the end is oblivion. Such is the cost.<br>
It is this one's opinion, that the fall of Maltos, although it may have been the birth of this one, it is not the only time this has happened.<br>
It is said that there is a place within the stars, within the astral sea that contains knowledge of the first iteration. But this one does not know where that is.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Well you said that you're created out of all this navigational knowledge, right?<br>
**Sai**: This one’s knowledge is not omniscient.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I know, but why don't we just go where you don't know?<br>
**Guy**: Didn't we see that too? Wouldn't that be those towers we saw?<br>
**Scrumpo**: That was on the edge of everything. At first, we were in the Dream, then we weren't. It was like the void, nothing.<br>
**Sai**: This one knows not of these towers.<br>
**Sai**: This one cannot go without coordinates. Do you have other inquiries?

### Sai's Missing Time

**Scrumpo**: Why is that you weren't able to specify an amount of time since last you were awake?<br>
***Sai** reveals his violet scar.<br>
**Guy**: are you corrupted?<br>
**Sai**: This one does not think so. This one is uncertain as to whether or not this one is corrupted. But this one knows one thing for certain: without this one you are stranded. This one believes you have no choice.<br>

### 20 Questions With Sai

The group continues to ask questions of the AI, Sai. Most with short one-line answers:

**Scrumpo**: Do you know what amber is?<br>
**Sai**: This one knows what amber is, yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you know what its purpose is?<br>
**Sai**: Amber is a material resource; it has no purpose.<br>
**Scrumpo**: It wards off the Violet.<br>
**Sai**: Skepticism.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We saw the Wheel of Time. What makes you think we don't know something like that?<br>
**Sai**: Skepticism.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look, doesn't matter. We're gonna fix you man, just stick with us.<br>
**Sai**: Skepticism.<br>
**Big Pipe**: You can be skeptical all you want, it worked.<br>
**Ikkar**: Do you trust us, Drifter?<br>
**Sai**: This one believes you will act in your nature.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Tell us about the other people who used this ship before we got on.<br>
**Sai**: Error.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Are you familiar with the Arch Keeper of Quierg?<br>
**Sai**: Error.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Show him the ring, Guy.<br>
***Guy** shows ring.<br>
**Sai**: Error.<br>
**Ikkar**: Do you know, was the Violet created on Maltos?<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Ikkar**: It wasn’t, so it was brought there?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Ikkar**: Maltos is inaccessible, yes?<br>
**Sai**: Maltos can be accessed by this one.<br>
**Ikkar**: I'm assuming we'd have to go through a screaming field of death?
**Sai**: Unknown.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Can you show us a list of all places you can go to.<br>
**Big Pipe**: And where we have the fuel to reach.<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.

(Astral Sea is projected around them)

**Big Pipe**: Are there planets on record, besides Maltos, that have an interaction with the Violet. Any sort of major event?<br>
**Sai**: Error.<br>
**Group**: I think getting this dude some amber and fixing him is a top priority.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How long ago were you on Maltos?<br>
**Sai**: It has been 122.4 celestial cycles.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Can you convert that to Kalkatesh time?<br>
**Sai**: 12204 years.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Is Taladon immortal?<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, you think that he's probably dead, then?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you have any idea where Taladon’s remains might be?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you think... He raised up a star with the 7 points on it, so why don't we go get that, I guess?<br>
**Scrumpo**: Is it in the same nebula as Maltos?<br>
**Sai**: Possibly.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, you only have a couple ideas of where it might be, are we gonna have to search?<br>
**Sai**: Unknown.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So if Pipe said to you "Take us to Taladon's remains", where are you gonna take us?<br>
**Sai**: This one would calculate Maltos.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So what you're telling me is that you think they're on Maltos?<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Guy**: Hey boy, do you know anything about my sword?<br>
**Sai**: This one knows that it is a powerful artifact but knows not of its applications.<br>
**Guy**: Well how do you know that and not the other?<br>
**Sai**: Confusion.<br>

### The Red Star of Annareth

Ikkar shows Sai the symbol of the red star and revelations about Annareth, The Astral Traveller, and her Handmaidens is revealed:

> **Sai**: This is the red star of Annareth.<br>
**Ikkar**: Who's Annareth?<br>
**Sai**: Annareth, disciple of Taladon.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So they were alive at the same time then?<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: How much longer after Taladon died did this person die?<br>
**Sai**: 22 celestial cycles (2200 years)<br>
**Big Pipe**: Are they also on Maltos?<br>
**Sai**: Negative. Most likely they are entombed in the red star of Annareth.<br>
**Ikkar**: That's a place?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative, this one knows the coordinates.<br>
**Huck**: Where is it?<br>

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eh6aOuj.jpg" alt="Galaxy map location of Annareth" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/eh6aOuj.jpg)

> **Ikkar**: Drifter, the names Versa, Kasaka, they're all disciples of Taladon, or disciples of Annareth? What's their connection?<br>
**Sai**: Negative. They are the six handmaidens to the Astral Traveller.<br>
**Ikkar**: I'm sorry, what?<br>
**Sai**: The hand maidens to the Astral Traveller. The inscription and inscribing of the disciple of Taladon, Annareth, bespoke of the six handmaidens who serve the Astral Traveller. It is rumored that the Astral Traveller is somehow connected to the first iteration. The final gift of Taladon was this knowledge.<br>
**Ikkar**: So, all these hand maidens, they're real people? Are they living, dead, immortal?<br>
**Sai**: They are deitic.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So the Astral Traveller is the big deity then, who is that?<br>
**Sai**: The Astral tra-a-v-<br>
**Arcadum**: One second please. One moment.<br>

> **Arcadum**: As the creature suddenly freezes, its face suddenly becomes contorted, and it no longer looks the same. And then, a voice will sound out:<br>
**Tiff (The Astral Traveller)**: Be careful what you seek, at the star the fates will meet.<br>
**Arcadum**: And then the creature returns to what it was.

### 20 More Questions With Sai

Highlights: Disk of Deletion (Hextremomere), Band's location, the shapes Ikkar saw in the library of the Translator on Quierg, Taladon's bloodline, and the power source of Maltosian weapons.

> **Ikkar**: Drifter. If I said a man with snake heads, does that ring any bells? Doesn't seem like a normal thing.<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Guy**: you don't need to say who the previous owner of the ship was, but I assume they were quite important, right?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Guy**: Are you aware of any of the specific weapons they created on Maltos, did the person who owned this ship have any involvement?<br>
**Sai**: Error. Error Error. One file found.<br>
**Sai**: This one remembers one of its kind was made as a weapon. The Disk of Deletion. This one remembers the violet within it.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What's its weakness, the Disk of Deletion?<br>
**Sai**: This one does not know its weakness. This one only knows its name and last location detected.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Where was it last located?<br>
**Sai**: It was last located to be on a colonization vessel headed to the planet known as Band. Its name is Hextremomere.<br>
**Big Pipe**: Where is Band?<br>
***Sai** points on map.
**Sai**: It is in the Rentoss Nebula.<br>
**Guy**: You said that the violet is refracted, can you explai-<br>
**Sai**: ERROR.<br>
**Big Pipe**: How much time does it take to use this vessel to travel from location to location?<br>
**Sai**: The vessels are able to extract themselves from the perception of the reality in which they are, and the reality in which they are not. The engines allow for the breaking of these two points. The dilation of times passage is lessened.<br>
**Ikkar**: Do you know anything about this symbol:<br>
***Ikkar** draws a circle, triangle, square, circle, in that order from outer to inner and shows it to drifter.<br>
**Sai**: The circle is sacred, the square is truth, the triangle is fortune. Fear thee the broken line.<br>
**Sai**: That was the symbol of Taladon.<br>
**Ikkar**: Have you ever heard of a candle of infinite flame?<br>
**Sai**: Yes, many. A simple item.<br>
**Ikkar**: The book that sort of gave me a glimpse of all civilizations rising and falling, it was all very confusing, and I could stop the page with my mind. There was the symbol of Taladon, it might have been his book.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Hey Drifter, do you know if Taladon had any kids?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you think his bloodline has managed to survive that whole time?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Do you know who might be his most recent relative?<br>
**Sai**: Records indicate that the last known bloodline reached the planet known as Verum, and the continent known as Kalkatesh. Updating... Updating... The last known relative of Taladon is a man by the name of Los.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I thought he was dead?<br>
**Sai**: Data indicates that Los still lives, although whereabouts unknown.<br>
**Ikkar**: Can you scan for anyone?<br>
**Sai**: Negative. Only individuals enacted into the Nexai.<br>
**Big Pipe**: What's a Nexai?<br>
**Sai**: ERROR.<br>
**Guy**: Did the Seven exist way back then?<br>
**Sai**: Affirmative.<br>
**Guy**: Have they always been around?<br>
**Sai**: Unknown.<br>
**Guy**: Did Maltos make them?<br>
**Sai**: Negative.<br>
**Ikkar**: Those weapons that Maltos made, what were they? You know the ones that called big purple guy?<br>
**Sai**: The weapons made by Maltos were reverse engineered from the remains of their fallen comrades, from the violet entity.<br>
**Ikkar**: So they were violet weapons?<br>
**Sai**: Yes.
