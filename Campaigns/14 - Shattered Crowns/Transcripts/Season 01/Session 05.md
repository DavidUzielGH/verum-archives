### Abandoned Market

Market has illusion magic cast on it to make it seem upkept and active.

Nearby a set of mausoleums, a fist of flame is etched on one of the mausoleum doors.
Inside is looted aside from a sarcophagus with a silver chalice containing a strange blue liquid. Chalice holds the tears of the loved ones of the buried Elf.

Scrumpo drinks the tears, and the symbol of the Namesaken appears on his chest.

Jodeheir Namesaken will appear as a spirit.<br>

Jodeheir requests that the party saves his brother. He came to bury Jodeheir, and was attacked by people looking to claim the market, which was granted to the Namesaken family from the Lord of Flowing Water.

The brothers' mausoleum is heavily trapped. The magic circle has a powerful necromantic seal that will deal [10d6] to anyone that walks into it. They free him.

Brother is magically kept unconscious via talismans. Guy removes the talismans and drinks his blood. Once the bindings and talismans and seals are removed the Elf awakens.

> **Kallon Namesaken**: I was accosted by the false court.

> **Kallon Namesaken**: The False Court were a penchant of minor elven lords who attempted to usurp power when the Lord of Flowing Water sealed himself away. It was they who took control of the aqueduct and made those who would normally get water freely in the great desert to pay for it, going against everything that the Lord of Flowing Water dictated. I was their most open opponent, and with my noble bearing I had the ability to stop them, until my family was hunted and I went into hiding. When my brother was killed I returned to bury him, it was then that they attacked me.

Kallon will swear the loyalty of his family to the party.
