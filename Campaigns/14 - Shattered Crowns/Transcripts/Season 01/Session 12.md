## Relevant Lore

Party goes through the portal unsealed after the enormous crystal was removed and enters the innermost sanctum of the Pyramid of Flowing Water, where the lord himself can be found. 

### Inner Sanctum

Party goes to the left room, where they find sarcophagi of servants buried with the lord of flowing water. Ornate door at the end of the hall has the symbol of a coin and balancing scale. 19 History check reveals it to be a symbol of trade, likely denoting occupation. Party finds a trap, disables it, and takes the coin chest from the coffin. 3 gold ingots worth 3000 gold total.

Party goes down to the statues at the bottom. Four ebony manticore statues, and eight brass warrior statues. Party faces the warriors' statues towards each other and gets a magical brass spear.

**Kinslayer spear**: Ritual attunement, covenant weapon, +2 spear, whenever you kill an enemy all enemies take [3d6] slashing damage, can chain off of killing blows.

Party investigates the right room, same thing as the left but with an Alchemist symbol. Party finds a bunch of potions.

Top-right room door has an eye with a pair of crossed swords. Ornate scrying pool in the center of the room, terracotta soldiers throughout the room. Vision of the Lord of Flowing Waters whispering to himself, half the vision missing. Pieces of the memory is missing.
Top-left room is the reflection of the right side. Other half of the vision is in here. 

Top-top left room contains scrolls and symbols of Falaael. Party finds a bunch of magic scrolls. Chest with a sapphire made of ice. Arcane Lock in frozen form. Party uses the key on the chest and it opens the chest. Vestments of Flowing Water.

Top-top right room scrolls with arcane symbols. Buncha magic scrolls, and a golden cog. Cog is a holy piece of a contraption of Brys. Chest has a ruby scimitar, and some dosh. Southern chest has a bag of holding.

Party proceeds to dump all of their possessions, including everything they've been making Huck "pack mule" for them into the bag of holding; finally free of excessive burden.

The party then thinks to ask if there was anything in the bag before they loaded their possesions into it by proceeding to dump everything onto the floor.

Yes.

In the bag of holding is a crystalline hand (monkey’s paw). Hand is called the Palm of Crystal Vices, represents, essentially, ambition unchecked. It is forged of astral crystals found within the sea between planes. It was forged by a mad wizard who thought to contain the power of wishes in an infinite sort of matrix. His hubris led to his body and soul being destroyed, but the crystal was created. It has long since been collected by Elven scholars as a reminder to the hubris of magic.

> **Arcadum**: You may ask for whatever you wish, but you will never be satisfied.

Party has four wishes, the thumb was already folded in.

#### Monkey's Paw Shenanigans -- Party's Wishes

> **Guy**: I wish to never spontaneously sing again.

The finger bends down, now you must sing for good.

> **Scrumpo**: Dear Hand, I formally request that there are no more gods.

One of the fingers goes down.

> **Pipe**: Dear Hand, present me with all of the materials needed to ascend as a true… Cyborg? Robot? Chosen of Brys.

> **Arcadum**: Make me a Constitution saving throw

18(15)

> **Arcadum**: You are unconscious as you are crushed under pounds and pounds of metal, before it dissipates, and the finger goes down. You can see a couple of the pieces you need in order to transform.

> **Huck**: I want us to go back in time to when we were emptying out the bag of holding, but we didn’t find the crystal hand in there.

The finger goes down. And the bag of holding is empty.

Bahroo begins to lose his mind that they've now lost literally all of their posessions. However, not all is lost as they remember that they had dumped the bag out in order to find the Hand. They return to the room they found the bag and all of their items are in the corner. However, the bag of holding is gone.

A figure is frozen on the throne.

Panel in front of the throne says:
> I looked down on my soldiers and I mused…”

waiting to be finished. Pipe finishes with the lines they figured out in the earlier puzzle:
> I weep for the lost, my tears are the water that feeds the land. Sorrow is plentiful, it is shared by all.

After finishing the panel the previous Lord of Flowing Water thaws, and the session ends.
