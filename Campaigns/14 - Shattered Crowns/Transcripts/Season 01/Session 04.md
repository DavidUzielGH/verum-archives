## Relevant Lore

### Lantern Lighter Maze:

Statue is of a Falaael priest, represents a spire knight, or spire lord directly translated. Elven runes say:

> By my sword, by my life, I seek to end thy strife.

Inserting scepter causes the symbol on the back of the statue to emanate a faint green glow.

Lord of Flowing Waters' tomb sank beneath the great lake of Aikar (sp?)

It is a fancy lantern, and inside the wick seems to be made out of an ethereal looking golden thread. 
Press a flame towards the wick and you may summon me whenever you wish.

### Scarab Wars:

> **Lantern Lighter**: When the Scarab wars began and the power of Majital was drunk too deep and drained, in order to preserve what yet remained of Kalkateshâ€™s land my lords had the wisdom to seal themselves away in a sort of burial truce. Should they awaken the war should continue anew, with their inheritors to take their place.<br>
When Emperor Twelvestar was betrayed by his son and the curse that wracked the Badlands created those that you call Dark Elves, so too did this splinter the Empire. Having no true heir remaining, each of the lords attempted to take their place, but the others did not agree, and so a war for who shall reign, known as the Scarab War, reigned through Majital. And so it was here that the truce was made, as each of the major combatants sealed themselves away. And thus have they waited, to where there is enough magic in the world for them to settle their scores.

> **Unknown/Scrumpo(?)**: Why do we need the Scarab Lords?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: The Scarab Lords yet hold control over the leylines. Without their ascension, forever will the world be closed off to them. Have you not seen? Even with my limited vision I can see it now. Since the Reckoning the world was broken, is it yet unmade. The Druids search for what they can, and all those that wander through Kalkatesth, they seek magic and fortune. They seek to restore what is made, but it is the Elven Lords that still hold the keys to the lost leylines.<br>
**Ikkar**: So there are five Scarab Lords?<br>
**Lantern Lighter(?)**: Negative, there are 13 Skarab Lords. Only 5 are connected to your scepter.
