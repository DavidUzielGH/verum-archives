### Coversation w/ Previous Lord of Flowing Water

> **Lord of Flowing Watter**: It seems that time has not been on your side, and the war of the Scarab Lords still rages deep beneath the sands.<br>

The Lord of Flowing Watter informs the party of the intruder in the archives. The presence of the usurper, the Bane of Man has escaped his prison.

> **Ikkar**: You mentioned the Bane of Man, right? Any relation to the Scorched King and the Heretic?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: Yes. The Scorched King, the Heretic, these are other lords of the Skarab, my brothers and sisters. We are all of us bound in service to the Emperor, but the Bane of Man has betrayed the ancient tryst. He has sought too much, he seeks to overtake what was once lost while we all have slept.
**Ikkar**: You said you were bound, how did he unbind?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: I am not entirely sure, we are all of us bound. Souls and flesh towards the service of the imperial throne, but perhaps, in some way… in some way he has escaped.<br>
**Ikkar**: Any idea where we might find him?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: The Bane of Man I believe, or at least that I hope, his body yet still remains bound within his prison, his spirit not fully yet manifested. With enough power, and perhaps enough haste, you could move to face him, and I would grant you the blessing of my strength. That you might take your place as the Inheritors of the water.<br>
**Huck**: This Bane of Man, did he have a name, by any chance?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: His name holds too much power to utter here.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Is it Laughing Kai?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: No, Laughing Kai is my forgemaster. <br>
**Ikkar**: Not anymore.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: He will provide you with the weapons-<br>
**Huck**: What sort of power can you offer us to help us fulfill our destiny?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: The power that I offer you is the power of water, and of the azure throne. All of the strength that I and my forefathers have possessed, and those allotted to me by the Imperial. However, I am afraid that all of this will be nought, for my ring yet lies beyond the northern door where the servant of the Bane of Man lies in wait. Without the ring the ritual cannot be complete, you cannot ascend. I am afraid you will have to face a great peril, one final time.<br>
**Pipe**: If you were to give your forgemaster a vacation, where do you think he would go?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: He would most likely return to his people, or at least what remains of them. <br>
**Ikkar**: Laughing Kai, bound, the fox tail woman, also bound, the merchant… You see where I'm going with this, why so much imprisonment?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: I can understand your confusion, truth be told I have done what I can to change the course of the minds of my people. The Imperium was many things, perfect was not one of them. The Elves of my time believed themselves to be superior, because they were yet long lived, but the binding of my servants were done only for the willing, and for those that wished to stave off the pain of mortal death.<br>
**Pipe**: Who are Laughing Kai’s people?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: His people are the Vega.<br>

Arcadum asks for History checks, Pipe rolls a 23.

> **Arcadum**: It is rumored that the Vega were an off-breed, or a different strand of human, specifically. Although you cannot recall exactly what it is, perhaps it is something that should be asked.<br>
**Pipe**: Who are the Vega?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: The Vega, some say, are true humanity. You see, the humans were created by the dragons of Dragonstar in the great war against my people and they. They were created as a cannon fodder, so to speak. But there was yet another strain of humanity, one that had existed in secret, and it is old. Some say that they had even existed simultaneously as my people, when the Eldar planted the world seed. Although, not many know where they came from, nor how they came to be, it is said that they serve the reflection in a great eye.<br>
**Guy**: So what you’re saying is that Elves are superior to men, and the Bane of Man is in the right.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: Absolutely not. Whether or not we are superior does not mean that we are to treat those that share this world with us this way. The Bane of Man would see humanity scoured from the surface of Kalkatesh, he would see your people enslaved, or turned to food for our beasts.<br>
**Guy**: I’m just saying it makes more sense than I thought, being that you made us and all that.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: No!<br>
**Guy**: didn’t you just say the Elves made the cannon fodder for the dragon war?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: No, the dragons made the humans.<br>
**Guy**: Are the dragonborn our daddies?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: No, they are the second attempt at a race’s creation by the dragons of Dragonstar, so I suppose they would be your brothers. <br>
**Guy**: Does the Bane of Man?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: No, he would see them destroyed.<br>
**Party**: What was up with the Harliot, and why is he imprisoned, and a dick?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: You must be referring to the Harliot. He is… crass. <br>
**Ikkar**: Can you fix the lantern?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: The Lamp Lighter, it has become cracked, it has been damaged. This was created so that it could not be done so easily, what occurred?<br>
**Ikkar**: There was a purple eyed Drow.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We made him face his past, we tried to restore his memories.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Watter**: What color were his eyes?<br>
**Guy**: Violet, specifically.<br>

The Lord of Flowing Waters expression will turn wrathful for the first time.

> **Lord of Flowing Water**: Did you say a Violet light?<br>
**Party**: Yes.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Water**: What news do you have of the surface? What has happened since I have slept?<br>
**Guy**: Be specific.<br>
**Lord of Flowing Water**: Is there anything precarious, anything that threatens the whole of all?<br>
**Guy**: I do have a scribe, a madman who wrote down the end of the world is coming, but maybe you could take a look? (Guy shows Lord of Flowing Water the scrolls of Erin)

The Lord of Flowing Waters will look down and pinch his brow as he reads the scrolls.

> **Lord of Flowing Waters**: The threads fray, they are being pulled. I must see for myself.

Lord of Flowing Waters will stand, and raise his hands above his head, summon water, and create a floating mirror of water. And there it is pointed towards the ceiling, which pierces stone and earth, until the sky is revealed. There within the sky, far in the distance, a single point of Violet light ascents the sky, small, but ever growing closer.

> **Huck**: What’s that?<br>
**Lord of Flowing Waters**: It would seem that the Herald has returned. <br>
**Lord of Flowing Waters**: Your time runs short, Inheritors. For the Bane of Man will cause too much strife and entropy.<br>
A creature who is dead, and once held unknowable power and prestige looks up like a shaking babe towards that which approaches in the sky.<br>
**Scrumpo**: The Bane of Man is a god, right?
**Lord of Flowing Waters**: No. He might consider himself to be so, but he is not.
