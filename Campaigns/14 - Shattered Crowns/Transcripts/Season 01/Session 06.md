(Vegan -- Of the Vega (not the non-meat kind))

Laughing Kai is a highly skilled smith of a magical forge. Group decides to free Kai after hearing he was "bound" to the forge by the previous Lord of Flowing Water.

Huck thinks he can manage to get the forge working anyway without him, gathers mana, blows up the forge, loses his moustache.

> **Lantern Lighter**: Did you free the Vegan forgemaster?<br>
**Ikkar**: Oh heâ€™s a Vega? I thought he was a vegan!<br>
Lantern Lighter: No, he is of the Vega. An ancient race of craft-.<br>
**Ikkar**: Where is he?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: He has probably returned to the Trigram Isles, my lords, where his people are from.<br>
**Huck**: How far away is that?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Oh it is quite far away my lords. No doubt he is attempting to revive those that he can find, and regain some of his people's power in order to enact vengeance upon those that have enslaved him. You have inherited his hatred for you.
