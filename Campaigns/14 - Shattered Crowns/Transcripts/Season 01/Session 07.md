## Relevant Lore

### Large Pool of Water

At the end of a frozen river/stream a large, ornate pool is found and appears to have a chest beneath the surface.

> **Arcadum**: You swim straight down, and when you get close enough you see that sitting atop this marble staircase is a beautiful, ornate, marble chest. It is designed in such a way as to resemble that of moonlight etched squarely across the face of the chest, and it is inlaid with sapphire. Who knows what the chest could contain, but the chest itself is undoubtedly worth money.<br>
<br>
Inside the chest is a crown made of moonrock, and it appears to be incomplete. You might call it an unrealized crown, a conceptual crown. Imagine a king's crown, but it’s only the thin piece at the bottom, so it’s kinda cut in half, it actually looks more like a circlet, but there are notches that would indicate that there is supposed to be more of it. But, the shard that you have with you, that you showed to the nobleman, it seems to fit this crown, although not the right piece, it’s a part of it though.

The group spots a massive koi fish in the water.

Guy swims down again and finds another chest. This time the chest is inlaid with emeralds. As Guy grabs the chest, the emeralds begin to light up, and the fish comes back around, and enrages as they take the chest. As they open the chest they see: two gold ingots, a bag of emeralds, and a dagger whose blade appears to radiate moonlight. 

**Moonfire Dagger**: +1 dagger that deals [1d6] radiant damage.

> **Guy**: Do you recognize my crown thing?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: You have found one of the next pieces of your inheritance. The Crown of Flowing Water is a potent magical device, and a signal to all those that would gaze upon your royal decrees.<br>
**Pipe**: Do you know where the rest of the pieces are, there seem to be a few parts missing, like it’s shattered or something.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: No doubt that the rest of the pieces will be found within the inner sanctums of the Lord of Flowing Water. Kept in preparation for his inheritance.<br>
**Pipe**: Do you know anything about the koi fish in this place?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: It is one of the guardians of this place, a favored pet of the Lord of Flowing Water.<br>
**Ikkar**: Is there perhaps an itinerant Lord of Flowing Water?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: It is possible that he has signed a regent to keep safe those that were buried with him. <br>
**Ikkar**: How’s he going to feel about the whole crown thing?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Hopefully, they will serve you willingly, but as I can sense even here there are some that have lost their way in service. Corruption, I fear, is a perilous yet common occurrence.

### Grand Halls of the Lord of Flowing Water

> **Arcadum**: As you enter the room you can see that there is a great mirror embedded in the center of the room, to the east and west there are water fountains which are there purely for what appears to be for decorative display. Seated on the mirror is an individual.

#### The Bound Brush:

> **Arcadum**: You see a strange woman, with many tails flowing out from beneath her dress. As she looks up as you approach you notice that her mouth is painted in such a way that it seems like her mouth is gone.<br>
**Guy**: How many people have come here before us?<br>
***Bound Brush** will hold up two fingers.

Lantern Lighter is summoned, and he doesn’t recognize the Bound Brush, however the Bound Brush recognizes the Lantern Lighter.


#### Mirrors/Pyramid of Flowing Water

Pipe touches one of the mirrors. His hand is now stuck to a strange, liquid-like material. The Bound Brush panics seeing Pipe stuck.

> **Arcadum**: As you touch the mirror with the scepter the fog begins to fade, and as it begins to fade it will reveal what appears to be the very woman sitting on that mirror, but you see instead that she is wearing tattered, torn clothing, and she is chained up against an ephemeral wall.

Scrumpo smashes the mirror, Ikkar picks up a big shard of glass.
As glass hits the ground, a film of dust covers the shards.

#### Big Mirror Room One:

You see Laughing Kai as he was as a man, a bronze skinned handsome devil, slamming the shit out of some iron on an anvil.
Big mirror in room two: You see the Lord of Flowing Water seated on his throne, commanding his subjects.

#### Art Room:

Golem Statue that is carefully and meticulously inlaid with jeweled stones. Holding in its hand what appears to be a golden staff. It seems to have a notch at the end, where one might place the scepter. As you place the scepter across the staff, and lock it into place the golem drops it on the ground, and now the staff is complete. 

Party now has the Inheritors Staff.<br>
-- Can enhance the magical capabilities of those that wield them.
