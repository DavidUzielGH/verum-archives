## Relevant Lore

Party continues exploring, Scrumpo finds Undercommon words of warning that say
> Beware thee the frigid frost, for deep below the hidden moss.

Party finds more gnomish scribbles, moves a rock and finds a lockbox. Lockbox contains: 5 trail rations, and a potion of greater healing.

Elvish inscription written on the ground
> Three tests, three guardians, three generals, three lights, three shadows, one door.

Corpses frozen in the water covered in a thin layer of blue moss. It seems that the moss is growing from within the corpses, you believe it came from inside them, perhaps from when they were still alive.

An [enormous crystal](https://i.imgur.com/fiQtf4W.jpg) that has been carved by skillful hands, most likely from Arcanists of Elven make.
> **Arcadum**: There are a couple things you need to study about it, give me 3 arcana checks. 

> Crystalline structure appears to be made a vessel for mana, there is magic inside of this thing. First, you may use it to revitalize your spell slots, but there is a chance something bad could happen.<br>
You can see that it is inscripted with Arcane circles that depict a specific spell programming. The matrix expands even further to reveal that this mana is contained within this vessel for a specific set of instructions, and then you recognize the insignia and inscription from earlier.<br>
That this mana contains the summoning force, as well as the divination required to determine your worthiness, and you can sense that it has heavy evocation, no doubt having to do with the line of magic going southwest. 

Sealed portal in the southwest where the magic line leads.


You see a stalagmite that’s covered in blue moss that’s frozen over. As you pull at the moss its pollen erupts. Ikkar begins to get covered in small fractals of ice.

Scrumpo makes an *oath* to the party.
