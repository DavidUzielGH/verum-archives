#### The Watchful Warden

Golden haired warden, wielding shield and a sword, armor is of the old elven emperium. It is a middle-aged elf around 300-400 years old. It is currently softly weeping into its hands.

Pipe puts a hand on its shoulder, hand passes through, warden looks at Pipe and freezes, as if it is suspended in a stasis, then dissipates. It repeats its movements.

Pipe taps it with the staff, and the vision becomes clearer.

> **Arcadum**: You see a battle hardened warden, with scars upon his face and arms, the shield and sword are worn with battle damage, obviously this individual has seen battle, and many times. Now you can hear soft sobbing, and you can see that the elementals are there no more, but there are instead the corpses of his fallen allies in crumpled heaps on the ground.

Pipe waves to get the Elf’s attention and he will look up behind and above Pipe.

> **Arcadum**: As you turn to look behind and above you you can see a strange shadow in the mist, what you believe to be some sort of humanoid, and then the vision becomes clear. You see yet another Elf, this one wearing grandiose robes, and a black mark across its chest. It will hold forward its hand and fire a bolt of lightning straight through the warden's face, tearing off his mouth and jaw, killing him instantly, and the image resets.<br>
You believe that you are either viewing a memory, or perhaps a wish, or something of that kind of nature.<br>
You stand between the warden and the caster, and the lightning bolt scours its way through to you, but then surges through you and into the staff. The staff now crackles with real lightning, and the image completely fades, and it does not reset.<br>

> ***Big Pipe** summons the Lantern Lighter<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Well done my lord, you have collected one of your memories.<br>
**Pipe**: What does that mean?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: It means that you have collected your memories.<br>
Pipe: You mean that was the Lord of Flowing Water?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Of course my lord, that was one of your memories.<br>
**Pipe**: Was I the… I saw an image of an elf being shot by lightning, was the lord of flowing waters the one that was being shot, or doing the shooting?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I am uncertain my lord, it is your memory.

Lantern Lighter explains that there are other memories in the room. Bahroo ends his watch and Guy takes over. Guy summons Lantern Lighter, confirms he’s the favorite, and has a conversation with the Lantern Lighter.

> **Guy**: What happens if one of us dies, is there an open seat, can I sell the seat?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Unfortunately, the body is not transient to the soul. The inheritor is chosen by soul, not body.<br>
**Guy**: Wait so you’re saying that if Scrumpo dies, and we complete this wacky Elf quest he will still inherit the throne?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Indeed my lord.<br>
**Guy**: Oh my god, do not tell him that, cause he’s just gonna ride this one out.

Guy offers to let the Lantern Lighter stay out of his lantern for a while. The Lantern Lighter will begin to weave ghostly threads as if he is knitting. Guy asks what he’s doing and he says it is a gift.

> **Arcadum**: Lantern Light continues to craft, and then you start to notice some real shit starts happening. Magic begins to get pulled out of the mist all around you, mana getting kind of like, conjured and coaxed out of the mist, and it begins to resonate within the ghostly threads. By the end of your watch you can see that the Lantern Lighter has worked quickly and has produced a robe of shining mist with the image of the moon, and he will hand it to you and say:<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: This is for the Lord of Flowing Water that wields the staff.<br>
**Guy**: But that’s not me.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Of course it is my lord, it is for you.<br>
**Guy**: Big Pipe has the staff.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I do not know what you mean, my lord.<br>
**Guy**: Are you feeling okay?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I am fine, my lord. Are you feeling okay?<br>
**Guy**: Yeah I’m feeling alright.

Guy will take another watch so the Lantern Lighter can stay out, and arcana checks the robe.

**Robe of the Mist Lord**: User of this robe gains a +1 to attack roles with spells that deal thunder, or lightning damage. The wielder of this robe heals an additional 3 hit points whenever they are healed. 

Guy will take the rest of the watches and pass out, leaving the Lantern Lighter to watch.

> **Lantern Lighter**: I do hope they live; longer than the last ones at least.

Group wakes up and banters with the Lantern Lighter about who his favorite lord is, which is all of them because he sees them all as one in the same.

> **Pipe**: Does the Lord of Flowing Water have a physical name?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Many.<br>
**Pipe**: Pick one, your favorite one.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Hmm… Jonis<br>
**Pipe**: How many Lords of Flowing Water have there been that you know of?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Fourteen. Indeed my lords, there have been 14 lords of flowing water, and 13 inheritors.<br>
**Pipe**: How many people have successfully inherited, fully?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: One.

Pipe explains what happened and how the staff is lightning, Huck tries to Bababooey for the first time.

> **Lantern Lighter**: Oh my lord, that is not the edict of command.<br>
**Pipe**: What’s the command?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: The edict of command is 'Nataris Nedelikir'.

Pipe points the staff and uses the edict of command, and the mist parts. Pipe asks to be told everything the group needs to know about the staff. Lantern Lighter refuses to answer to protect their minds, and tells Pipe that they must ask the right questions. Lantern Lighter tells them to get the rest of the memories. Ikkar changes the edict of command to `Bababooey`. Group scouts and ventures to the rest of the memories.

### The Collegiate:

> **Arcadum**: You see an Elven man with a thoughtful look on his face. He is currently studying an ancient tome very carefully, his hands delicately move the parchment to the side, and begins to read through.<br>
***Ikkar** attempts to read over his shoulder<br>
**Arcadum**: He is apparently reading through a history of heraldries. Specifically he is researching the legacy of the family line Twelvestar.

(History checks -- 18)

> **Arcadum**: With an 18 you know that the Twelvestar line may be in reference to the last standing emperor of the Elven imperium, whose name was Synonine Twelvestar  (Cyrodin?)(sp?). 

> **Arcadum**: The memory continues, this particular Elf continues reading, and looks to the side, almost as if one might gaze out a window. He frowns, and leans forward as if just able to make out something, and then a crossbow bolt erupts through the back of his head, and he will fall to the ground. The memory will reset.<br>

Big Pipe stands in front of the crossbow bolt,

>**Arcadum**: It will pass through Big Pipe, and it seems as though nothing has happened. The memory will continue to repeat.

Pipe will touch the staff to the book, and it will be absorbed into the staff, and it begins to swirl with arcane force, as the knowledge within the book is stored in the staff, and thus the memory begins to fade. Party will move to the next memory.

### The Prisoner:

In this memory you see a man in chains, and he’s shackled against a wall.

> **Moon**: He’s a Drow, ew.<br>
**Arcadum**: In fact he is, he is a Drow.<br>
And he is hanging suspended, and you’re basically watching him just hang there in his misery. Tears streak down the angles of his sharp edged face, and drip into small pools on the floor of his cell.<br>
Eventually the Drow looks up, looking around as if hearing something, and as he looks up you can see fire begins to pour into the cell. The Drow screams out for the guards to save him, but slowly he watches as the fire gets closer, and closer, and begins to burn against his hands, melting his flesh from his bones, and he watches the fire slowly etch up to his face, before he dies, and then the memory repeats. 

The staff is touched to the pool of tears, and the tears vanish, and are absorbed within the staff. You have absorbed the sorrow of this memory.

> **Arcadum**: Ster, you are bound for this next part, you may not speak.

> **Arcadum**: As the prisoner begins to fade some of him stays behind, and the eyes radiating a violet color look at each of you. The eyes are questioning, challenging, wanting. What do you do?

Pipe looks at his eyes, and the eyes keep watching back, waiting for you to make a move. The memory does not fade.

> **Bahroo**: It’s just one set of eyes, right?<br>
**Arcadum**: It’s the eyes of the Drow.<br>
**Bahroo**: Is he still there or is it just the eyes now?<br>
**Arcadum**: Well the rest of him is fading, but the eyes are strong, and have high resolution, as if they are somehow more potent than the rest of the memory.<br>

> **Pipe**: Can you speak?<br>

> **Arcadum**: More of the memory becomes more resolved, speaking to it seems to have emboldened the memory. Now the face reforms and it smiles, and nods.

> **Pipe**: What’s wrong with you?

> **Arcadum**: The memory increases its clarity further and it pulls on the chains, and then looks up at them and back to you with a meaningful look.

> **Pipe**: So you just need me to keep talking?

> **Arcadum**: The memory gets stronger, and stronger, and the Elf nods.

Pipe looks behind him, is everyone else quiet?

You notice the Lantern Lighter is frozen solid as if they cannot move. Pipe shushes the group, and goes to the Lantern Lighter.

> **Arcadum**: It’s almost as if the Lantern Lighter is frozen in stasis, unmoving. It does not respond to you as you approach. It’s always been difficult to know if such a creature would feel, or have a personality, but it always responded when you approached, almost like it would look at you with attention, but this is different. It is frozen in place, and does not respond as you approach.<br>
> **Pipe**: Lantern Lighter?

Pipe speaks to Huck, commenting that talking to the Prisoner makes it stronger, however you have to speak directly to it. Group talks about how the Lantern Lighter is frozen, and how to approach talking to the Prisoner, and they try to figure who the Prisoner is, if it’s the Lantern Lighter or not.

> **Pipe**: Are you the Lantern Lighter?<br>
**Arcadum**: The Prisoner smiles, the memory fully realized. The chains begin to shake, and crack. They fall away, and the Prisoner will stand. Veins of violet energy will begin to etch across its face, along its chest, and down to its hands. It will give a bow, and will vanish.

The Lantern Lighter awakes and floats towards the group as if nothing happened.

> Pipe: Do you remember anything of before you were this Lantern Lighter?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I do not. More accurately, I do remember, but cannot.<br>
**Ikkar**: So your memories are sealed, one might say?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I suppose you might use that terminology, my lord, yes.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So you know you were tortured and basically forced into servitude?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Oh, that did not happen, my lord.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Oh really?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: Indeed.<br>
**Scrumpo**: We saw your mortal form, and you were being tortured.<br>
**Pipe**: We saw you engulfed in flames, and melt your chains.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: That did not happen. My form was sacrificed many times, by my own volition. Specifically in the final confrontation against that which cannot be named.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Uh, okay.<br>
Ikkar: Are you a lich?<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I can understand the inclination to believe that, my lord. But no, I am a spirit bound within an object.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I do have an inquiry my lord. What happened to me a moment ago, I do not remember moving from here to here, was I put back within the lantern?<br>
**Pipe**: No, when we interacted with this memory, you were frozen.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: That is odd, my lord, I wonder why that is. I am sorry to have failed to serve you.<br>
**Pipe**: Probably because you can’t view your own memory.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: What do you mean, my lord? Are you saying that you saw me?<br>
**Pipe**: Well I asked the memory if they were the lantern lighter, they simply smiled and then nodded their head, and then poof.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: That does not sound like something I would do, what did you see?<br>
**Pipe**: I saw an elf bound in chains with glowing eyes, the more we talked to it directly, the more it smiled and nodded to us, and told us to keep talking.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: But I was never imprisoned.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Yeah because the person who imprisoned you made you forget.<br>
**Lantern Lighter**: I see.<br>
**Scrumpo**: It was probably us.<br>
**Pipe**: I wonder if the staff can give you back your memory.<br>

Group contemplates which memories to give back to the Lantern Lighter. Pipe taps the staff to the Lantern Lighter and unlocks all of its memories. There is an explosion of Violet energy, specifically from the staff. The Lantern Lighter holds up its hands towards its head and lets out a scream.

> **Lantern Lighter**: That of which is unknown cannot be known, that which was granted to abou- that which was granted shall not be taken. Only thee that look, only thee that look deep within the sands of the twelve of the thirteen and the four, only then will you know the sun and moons trial. Only then will you see what was taken, only then will you see the truth. My lord take it away, please.


Party resets Lantern Lighter, and talks about how messed up that was, then moves on to the final memory.


### The Skywitch:

> **Arcadum**: You see the robed figure from before. The one that blasted that other guy. You see that as she lands it is revealed that, as she lands, it is revealed to be a follower of Wode. As the individual lands you notice that she begins to scour through bones, skulls, and corpses, as if looking for something, and then she lifts it up. You see a skull, a burned skull, within a ruin of rubble. The skin is blackened, and scorched, and there is the smallest twinkle of Violet light. It is dropped, the individual stands above, and unleashes a lightning bolt into the skull, destroying the corpse, before she is impaled from behind by a spear from an unknown assailant. And then the memory resets.

Pipe touches the staff to the skull that she drops. Oh boy.

> **Lantern Lighter**: No my lords, no! That is not- *pain noises*

The Lantern Lighter is now frozen again. The party continues this course. The skull is absorbed, and this memory fades.

The Lantern Lighter dissipates. Ikkar blows on the lantern, and the Lantern Lighter does not return. Pipe touches the staff to the lantern, and nothing happens. Party talks about whether what happened to the Lantern Lighter was a good thing.

There is still magic within the lantern, although it is embers to what was once a lively flame. Ikkar investigates the lantern, it is conjury and necromancy. As was clearly stated by the Lantern Lighter, his soul is bound within the lantern. Somehow, something has exhausted it, you believe he will return in time, but for now his guidance is unavailable to you.

Group casts Bababooey and a key is formed within their hands. They bicker, go back up the stairs, and the session ends.
