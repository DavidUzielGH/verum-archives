## Relevant Lore

Scrumpo goes to the Dream when he dies.

> **Arcadum**: What you are walking on is essentially different pieces of crystallized stone, made not of rubies or emeralds, but rather emotions and wants. You walk upon the literal manifestation of who you are, and how it is mixed with the wants and needs of others.

Scrumpo has a conversation with Chuuk. Chuuk was killed by friendly fire, and has become a dreamweaver, serving the great undulating mother. 

Chuuk hands Scrumpo a bandage, which has a Elvish script written on the inside. The expanse of the dream behind you has formed from your heavy words speaking of the Bane of Man. For as you have spoken the words the great dream of the dead, but not destroyed, lich, like a poisonous effigy floats through the Great Dream has been attracted to the words you have spoken, and within it you see all of his hate, and the malice, and power. That even death, a veil and door that all must walk through, yet remains open for him.

> **Scrumpo**: Do I ever get to see the lords of the Great Dream?<br>
**Chuuk**: You already have.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Don’t tell me you’re one of them?<br>
**Arcadum**: And Chuuk will turn into smoke.


Party ascends to Lords of Flowing Water, and gains level 6. They also, eventually and after much debate, revive Scrumpo.

This episode turns into a lot of bookkeeping for things that... may not be relevant later in season 2.
