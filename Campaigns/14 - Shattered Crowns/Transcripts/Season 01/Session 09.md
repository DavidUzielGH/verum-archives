## Relevant Lore

### Return to the Art Room
Some of the paintings are more clear than they were before. Before they were opaque, and now they are clear.

This one has a picture of a warden with a mighty greatsword.

Arcadum asks if anyone took notes.

> **Arcadum**: You notice these paintings seem to represent the visions you were given by the spirits, but there is something wrong. If you can notice something wrong you can make it right.


#### Warden:

Has a greatsword, should be a sword and shield. Huck is given a martial check to remember the correct weapon, rolls a 13. Once corrected a small chest appears, containing a brilliant shield. Shield is a magical shield, covered in kaleidoscopic paints. Shield of spiraling patterns is a shield that allows color spray to be cast 3 times per long rest.


#### The Collegiate:

Group guesses that the mage guild symbol should be of Wode instead. Black chest appears, trapped with a curse that removes benefit from long rest. Rolls 22 on sleight of hand, disabling trap. Inside is a symbol of Wode. You do not sense it is enchanted, but you feel like it has grave importance, you just need to figure where and how it can be applied. This symbol is radiating with holy energy, meaning that it is hallowed. Whatever application this symbol could have, you know that it has a lot of the favor of Wode within it.

#### Skywitch:

She hovers over the battlefield with complete and utter command, her Taladonic armor, and the wielding of magical might shows her to be a war wizard of types. Her beautiful face is heavily scarred, marred from countless battles.

Group chooses to remove scars. Chest appears beneath, containing a potion of Heal. 70hp restore.

#### The Prisoner:

You see a male Drow hanging from chains he looks around with a bit of fear and despair in his blue eyes. (Eyes should be violet). Group paints eyes red, nothing happens, then violet. The painting erupts in violet flames, and the chest that is summoned has violet veins pulsing through it, almost like a heartbeat.

Guy bites the vein and tries to suck the chests blood, rolls a 17 strength check. Sucks nothing, and gets stuck.

Guy then opens the chest. You open the chest and see nothing inside. The room begins to quake, the pyramid shaking, the lights in the area growing dark, and then back to light as if something has passed. 

Arcadum rolls a d5, picks Pipe. You notice something in the chest. What was once empty after the entity fades, you see that something has been summoned. You see another holy symbol, but this one is of the Seven.

Pipe points out the symbol, and everyone sees the symbol of the Seven. Pipe picks up the symbol and examines it. 

As you grasp the symbol, something odd happens. You see a vision, far from where you are, of a man in black armor rebuilding an old abbey, and then it flashes back to you. 

Ikkar touches the symbol, nothing seems to happen.

Scrumpo touches the symbol, and visions begin to flash through his mind. You see yourself through the eyes of a wise and powerful wizard that stands out over the expanse of an unknown continent. Robed servants approach you and respectfully dab in salute, then go about their ways. A great tower is built, and you stand atop it, concerning yourself with all those that lie below in the valley. It flashes again, you find yourself wielding a greatsword, fighting on the shores of an unknown place against mighty giants, and unknown threats. Your companions speak a strange language that you do not understand, and they fight alongside you, and within it you hear the deep thrumming of a mighty bass. 

Guy touches the symbol. You find yourself being a strange half-elf that is creating chairs. The next, you find yourself an insufferable woman with mighty opinions, an insufferable girl with equally mighty opinions. You find yourself as an effeminate squid boy with mighty opinions. You find yourself on the same battlefield, distant and away on islands, fighting alongside your brother. You also see yourself as a strange fishman with mighty opinions. And you see yourself as a young war priest, that is obsessed with the change of puberty. There is an angry goblin character that spoke about how menacing he was, and then there was a monkey with a wizards hat. Essentially you go through seven hundred million visions.

Symbol is given to Ronnie. Visions begin to swirl through Ronnie’s eyes, he too sees a strange past. He sees himself as a kind of annoying fox boy, a weirdly effeminate and really really pushy cyborg. And he also sees himself as an awesome fat samurai with a cool-ass bear. And a cool tavern dwarf lady. Ronnie also has a vision of a very sad individual with a pillow full of rocks, talking to a very sad, but very buff, man.

Huck touches the symbol, nothing happens.

### Return to the Mirror Rooms

Group goes to the right-side rooms and touches the mirrors with the staff. 

**Top-right**: As you touch this mirror, a vision begins to appear on its reflective surface. You see what is perhaps the Lord of Flowing Water in one of the past lives that was depicted to you by the Lantern lighter. You also see a strangely familiar man, whose features you can’t quite place, but whose presence is undeniably familiar to you, kneeling at the side of the Lord of Flowing Water. You see the Lord lean to the side as if gesturing to the kneeling man, who whispers something into his ear, the Lord will nod, a smile forming on his face. You see that he gives out a command, and then, you see an image of growing crops, of fed people, of plenty and prosperity. 

Could Ikkar read his lips? Yes, please do so with the insight check you made, with advantage due to Actor. Ikkar rolls: `25(20)`.

When he leans to his advisor, he says:
> My people suffer, what can I do to aid them?

And the advisor whispers:
> Give of them the rain for 3 months my lord, and then from that they shall save the plenty, and survive the drought.

The lord smiles, and his command is:
> “Go forth, for only through my rain will my people find salvation.”


**Rightmost Room**: This one appears to follow the same continuity of the other vision, specifically this is the time of fallow fields, so as where once there was plenty, now comes the time of the drought, and as such you can see that there are great silos of grains, in which the Lord of Flowing Water is nodding and his lieutenants are going through and checking things off and feeding people through the time of plenty. One of the silos has a different symbol from the Lord of Flowing Water, and from what you’re able to notice the Lord in this vision looks at it with a frown, concern, and a mixture of hate and fear.

Ikkar rolls a `20` on History.

You recognize that symbol, it represents one of the Scarab Lords, and the worst one of all. The one who believed that all non-Elves were a blight upon the earth, especially the humans. His name was the Bane of Man.

### Return to the Bound Brush

She will take the key, and touch it to the mirror, and a vision will appear.

The vision reveals an icebound chest, deep beneath your current position, in a winding cavern, and then she will point to the key and hand it back to you.

Pipe will use the staff on the Bound Brush’s chains, and they fall away. She smiles and stands at her full height. Her veil falls away, and her mouth, which was once stitched shut, opens. And then she will say “Thank you my lords, you have freed me. I hope I do not have to remove my limbs.” 

> **Bound Brush**: I stand ready to serve.<br>
**Guy**: Who are you? Tell us about yourself.<br>
**Bound Brush**: There is not much to say about myself, my lords. I am the Bound Brush, I am a servant.<br>
**Guy**: Now you’re just the Brush.<br>
**Bound Brush**: Oh no, I am still bound to your service, but now I am no longer chained.<br>
**Pipe**: Why were you chained in the first place?<br>
**Bound Brush**: I was chained for my own protection, it was the only way to keep me safe from the enemies of the Lord of Flowing Water, specifically the Bane of Man.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Why would the Bane of Man be the enemy of the Lord of Flowing Water?<br>
**Bound Brush**: Because the Lord of Flowing Water believed in peace and equality between all the races, he was constantly at odds with the Bane of Man. During the great Scarab Wars, when the emperor died, they were vying for powers. Yes, for who would lead the Elven race, but there was also a  moral battle, a battle between good and evil. When the Scarab Lords fought to a standstill it was decided that they would all sleep beneath the sands, lest they destroy what remained of Majital, and thus they have slept, awaiting their Inheritors.<br>
**Pipe**: I’m still confused as to how tying you up is any different, how does that protect you?<br>
**Bound Brush**: I was unable to be taken from my prison, or harmed, well, mostly that is, from any that is not my Lord. So my imprisonment kept me safe.<br>
**Pipe**: But you wanted us to free you, didn’t you?<br>
**Bound Brush**: Of course, for you are the Lords returned.<br>
**Ikkar**: So when we were first asking if we should explore the palace you seemed quite terrified, why?<br>
**Bound Brush**: I did not know if the enemies of the Lord of Flowing water yet still remained.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Are you a demon?<br>
**Bound Brush**: No, I am a walker of skin. I am known as a Kitsune.<br>
I am a muse, of sorts. I was tasked with upkeeping the culture, and arts, of the Lord of Flowing water, I also danced for him for his entertainment. My healing touch restored any maladies and even slowed the process of aging, but not completely.

> **Arcadum**: She can make you younger, not adjust your lifespan.

The Bound Brush will say the pan flute is the Lord of Flowing Waters favorite instrument, and play a song for them. She will give the pan flute to Guy.

(Pan flute is magic, does some stuff, idk I didn’t pay attention cause it was mostly banter -- SpeedJump)

### Party Descends Further Into the Pyramid

They proceed down into the cave under the Pyramid.

Party finds a skeleton.
> **Arcadum**: You see that it was wearing old Elven robes, perhaps it was an imperial servant. Trapped under the ice, you will notice its skull is caved in.<br>
These are [plants](https://i.imgur.com/40dR5wR.jpg). They appear to be something like urchins, they are basically icy aloe vera plants.

Ikkar picks a handful, 17 Nature. If you were to brew this particular plant into a tea, you could make doses of remove poison. Party gathers enough for 6 doses to brew into remove poison tea.

Group continues spelunking, disabling traps, runs into 7 guards and fights them.

Party finds 7 frozen coins.

Session Ends.
