Ahst, guardian of the Life Stream, enters a room within the Shadow of Tyre holding tapestries:

> **Arcadum**: Ahst, in this room you see tapestries lined up all around you in seven different spaces. On the ground in front of you, you can see that there are several tapestries that are torn up, like apart, almost as if from battle damage from spear thrusts, from arrows, from slashes of axe, of tooth and nail, of sword--all manners of damage.<br>
> ***Ahst** kneels down and strokes the damaged tapestry.<br>
> **Arcadum**: The tapestry in front of you, your hands a light touch, but what happens next you did not expect. For the tapestries that you touch shift almost as if from an unseen wind. They disperse like dust, sparkling with light within, before it is revealed to you that these are no normal tapestries. Only through the stillness of being undisturbed did they seem to be. For what you see is somehow, someway, a stolen piece of the Tapestry of Fate.
>
> All around you it begins. With a new presence in the room, and the first touch, all of the tapestries begin to move at once. The wind of life blows through Ahst and through her blade as a Guardian of the Life Stream stands within a hallowed place. Each tapestry begins to flash with images representing a different piece of a journey that has yet to be fully realized, and so it awaits your next action. What will you do?

> **Strippin (Ahst)**: Um- what do I see? Is it- are they forming a single tapestry?<br>
**Arcadum**: Slowly the scenes unveil before you. In this order:<br>
[ 1 2 3 ]<br>
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;]<br>
[ 4 5 6 ]

> **Arcadum**: So, this is what you see. Within the first tapestry you see a verdant swamp, surrounded by the lush greenness of land and before you a ziggurat rises from the horizon. The dancing of Kobolds and the playing of their drums, and standing at the top a great lizard man wielding a grafted longsword of bone and sinew cries out. Holding up a black chalice before it freezes in place.
>
> The next tapestry shows a deep cavern with a split door of five murals down the center and deep through the depths you find yourself walking through a complex until finally you arrive at the end where there is an abandoned bath house. And along the back of the wall a great pillar where a great construct of black undead and torn skin and a proud horned crown of opals and black shale, an obsidian horn.
>
> The next, which is a verdant jungle, rife with life, a black cloud of smoke and smog swirls above. White-scaled troglodytes move through the jungle in errant tribes and at the center a large beast still sleeps. Awaiting to be disturbed. 
>
> The fourth tapestry reveals to you white-out conditions as a great snowing blizzard blows through the mountains on high. You see that the ways the crags are choked, and there is a Dwarven construct of an entrance that leads inside an unhallowed place where death and destruction and blood still yet stain the ancient cobblestones. There you see Dwarves turned into furniture and atop a throne made from kings and nobles a laughing, smiling lich looks down upon you.
>
> Upon the fifth, a great city, dark and abandoned. A cathedral to an unknown religions yet stand unseen and worshipped. These images swirl around you, piece by piece by piece, bit by bit.
>
> Upon the sixth tapestry you find yourself in a vault. A vault of errant treasures rising up all around you. A very- a ship within a bottle. Gold, jewels, christened weapons and armor, and a laughing dark elf.
>
> And then upon the seventh tapestry you see nothing. Curiously blank, the longer you look, the more that you feel that there is something there, something unseen, something yet to be witnessed, something that waits, and then the voices begin to call out to you. With each errant whisper, an image comes into place. You see water begin to wave out, a beach of white sands turned black. Beyond that, trees where instead of green there are white errant leaves and white grass. This monochromatic dichotomy unsettling to gaze and then against the backdrop you see a forbidden place hidden within the stars.
>
> The voices call out again, all at one, rising up, until you see that the Tapestry shifts above and you can see that somewhere the story is written. The seven points combine together to show the symbol of The Seven. A journey that has been made several times, over and over again. All of these images refract and reflect around you, until finally the tapestries grow silent and still. Until the torn tapestries behind you begin to reweave themselves and you see them. Torches being passed from person to person, from hero to hero, and slowly they begin to swirl together again, like the makeshift hand of an old tailor. A seamstress weaves them back and forth, repairing what was lost. You see as they begin to be repaired they are damaged again and in a constant struggle of back and forth, of flow and ebb, of death and life.
>
> Eventually, the tapestries begin to slow themselves and then they grow silent once more. Silent but thrumming with life deep beneath and then you see yourself. Three points, three Guardians, three rings, three swords. They combine into a singular triangle. A trigram etched upon one of the tapestries and the center of the room. One that had been lost and one that shall be lost no more. There it lies before you, waiting to be claimed.<br>
***Ahst** retrieves the fabric which rolls itself into a scroll
