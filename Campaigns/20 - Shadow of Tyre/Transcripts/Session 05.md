# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 05

Aired: 07/25/2020

Still within their wing of Tyre's Labyrinth the party happens upon a seemingly peaceful room with a pond in the middle of it.

## Relevant Lore

> **Arcadum**: Alright, listen carefully to this description.<br>
There are seven koi within the pond. One of the koi swims in the center, and it bears scales of black and white, the other koi swim in a continuous circle around it. One koi is a brilliant viridian blue, the next koi is a soft orange, the next koi is a brilliant crimson, the next koi is iridescent with many colors, but with a clear string of yellow, the next koi is an elegant emerald, and the final koi shines with a bright, white, luminescence.<br>
**Alex (Toot)**: Can we make a check to learn more about it?<br>
**Arcadum**: I will give you an incredibly unlikely Nature check.

(Alex rolls a 24, nat 20+4 from Guidance)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, in the order that I described them to you:<br>
As you study carefully, you can see that in the common tongue, curiously enough, written on the backs of the koi fish you notice names that are hidden. In the order that I described them to you, Verum, Haates, Dailos, Verza, Kasaka, Jhasa, and Rentoss.<br>
Arcana, for more info, and it's gonna take another roll like that.<br>
***Toot** points out the names on the fish to everyone.

(Criken rolls a 19=16+3)

> **Arcadum**: This is insufficient to gain more information on the significance of those names.<br>
However, Toot. Your eye begins to shine. Toot, you see that there is another creature in the pond, you do not see a koi, but rather a serpent.<br>
***Toot** immediately starts pointing.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you look closer you spot it, it appears to be a serpent, but it is unmoving, but it is most certainly alive as it is watching the movements of the fish above it. The serpent is covered in mud, and therefore its color is not obvious.<br>
<br>
As Toot starts to move up his eyepatch, you notice it is glowing, Moe.<br>
***Eustace** will pull the serpent out of the water using Shape Water.<br>
**Arcadum**: When the serpent leaves the water it transforms. It transforms from a serpent into a key. The key bears a very specific description. It is long, longer than a normal key. The edges at the end are serrated and curved, and there is a name etched into the side of it, and it is written in common, and it says "The Twilight Station".<br>
<br>
When the key formulates, Ahst you nearly fall over. Your portal senses begin to pulse hard, as the energy only you can feel wafts over you. It's coming from the south.<br>
<br>
Eustace, you turn your gaze into the pond as you remove the key, and one by one, each of the koi fish perish. They evaporate into Violet ash until, finally, the last one remains. Verum remains.<br>
The fish swims towards the surface of the water, jumps up and out, and it shatters like glass.<br>
<br>
Raost at this point the door your on begins to shake, as now the energy from whatever is happening down south is able to be sensed by all of you, not just Ahst.

> **Arcadum**: As you grasp the key, Eustace, your true sight activates on its own.

(Lumina starts to play)

> **Arcadum**: The being that forms before you, Eustace, as you hold and grasp the key is one of your kind, a Monk. A practitioner of the magic of the body, covered from head to toe in ritual tattoos, and with bandaged arms. He fully forms and he has on his chest a tattoo of twin wolves, one of darkness and death, and one of life and plenty, in a constant battle around his heart.<br>
As he appears before you he will give a wistful smile, a little sad, and he will say:<br>
> **Unknown Monk**: It seems I ran out of time. Unfortunate. I had hoped to taste the world a little longer, but it seems that my duty has been called. So be it.

(He will walk up towards Eustace and offer his hand)

> **Tane**: I greet you, hero. I am Tane, the Cardinal of the Seven.
***Eustace** will grasp his hand and give kind of a sheepish smile, and say<br>
**Eustace**: Haven't quite earned the title of hero, yet.<br>
**Tane**: Any that walk the path that you are about to face is worthy of it in my eyes. I have done what I can to slow the Violet presence, but it is coming. And The Seven, yet shadows, are embers within the flame that you now hold the torch of. It is time to light the fire of heroism, to face this enemy once more. You now wield the key to the Twilight Station, and thus you have reached the threshold of knowledge.<br>
You and your companions, and your companions within the camp, will no doubt benefit from this knowledge. But remember, the Enemy that you face is an enemy that wields knowledge against those that would use it, a difficult and harrowing challenge to say the least. But make no mistake, the Violet has been defeated before, it will try to convince you that it is impossible, but it can be.<br>
***Tane** will place his hand on Eustace's shoulder, and will look him in the eye and say:<br>
**Tane**: I will not, however, grant you false hope. Your journey, that you and your companions face, will be beyond anything that any of you will expect. It is my hope, however, that you will prevail. For in the end that is the only thing that the Violet cannot destroy, Hope and Faith.<br>
Now. You wield the key, one of three. Keep it safe, and keep it close. The Enemy senses you, it's time to face it, but you will not face it alone.<br>
***Tane** will strap down his arms and tie up his hair.<br>
**Tane**: The time has come, gather yourselves, heroes, and show me if you are worthy Torchbearers!

---

> **Eustace**: Thanks for the assist, brother.<br>
**Tane**: You are most welcome. Now, it has been some time since I have tested my strength, I am ready.<br>
***Tane** will "OSU" and generate power out of his tattoos.<br>
***Tane** will place a hand on Raostâ€™s back and say:<br>
**Tane**: My friend, we are not the ones that wait for the Enemy. The Enemy quivers before us. Open the door.<br>
***Raost** busts open the door.<br>
**Tane**: I understand that my time in the story is nearly done, but if you will allow me, I would like to take point.<br>
At my back, heroes! Do not fear the darkness!<br>
***Tane** smashes through two doors down into the room where the Violet servant waits

The party prepares.

> ***Tane** will place his foot on the ground in front of him, and will draw a line. It will radiate with black ink, and he will simply stand there and wait.<br>
**Tane**: The enemy comes, you may not be able to see it yet, but I know that the Ranger senses it.
