# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 19

Aired: 11/14/2020

## Relevant Lore

With the help of the Eassemere Dwarves some smithing requests can be finished in one day. Igor has received advanced alchemical tools and seeks the tooth of an immortal. Odin is not immortal. Shadow hands the eternity elixir to Igor.

Eustace heads to the beach and meditates to alert the Silent Knights of the impending attack on the camp. Ahst presents the idea of heading to the Badlands to pick up the Sun's Passage; a tool for portals. Group plans out the most efficient path for getting all of their sidequest stuff done.

### Silent Knights Cameo

Mirage will have a discussion with the Vizier about handling the Speaker. If the Speaker returns to camp at full strength it's likely the camp will be lost. The Vizier will summon the Silent Knights.

> **Vizier**: Wherever the Enemy moves in the waking realm, a reflection moves within the Dream realm as well.

Mirage and the Silent Knights are heading to the Dream realm to find the dreaming part of the Speaker, to understand it, and hopefully weaken it.

It is revealed that Mirage is necessary for finding new Chords and hopefully being in the Dream will grant some aid in that regard.

Before leaving, Mirage buffs Ahst and Ahst feels as if her mastery of her Songblade has increased.

### Toot Summons Hizigori

Toot summons Hizigori and offers himself to be a cleric of Hizigori.

> **Hizigori**: To put faith in me- I fear that I am unworthy, but I will not turn away your gift of faith. My power is not my own, it is sworn to the stars and swirls just beyond. If that is what you wish, then so be it.<br>
Know this, that the strength of the stars is unpredictable. I know not how your celestial mantle will manifest. You may change, do you accept this risk?<br>
**Toot**: HAI, ONEGAISHIMASU!<br>
**Hizigori**: So be it.

> **Arcadum**: Hizigori will unleash his breath weapon upon Toot.
>
> The power of stars, of comets, of meteors, of shining light in the night sky swirls around Toot. And where there was once a Royal Kenku, marred and scarred by the trials and tribulations of his life, the strength of the stars takes place. Infusing themselves within his feathers, within his body, within his mind. And thus, you are granted the strength of the stars and Hizigori's gift. Your race changes. You are no longer a Kenku, but rather you are a Phoenixborn.
>
> As the magic fades, Toot's yellow feathers are now adorned in white, the edges of which are adorned in starlight. He is taller, thinner, stronger. He is also adorned in the armaments of the Star Legion, which means that he essentially is like a samurai that wears a straw hat, except his has a veil of starlight around it. He's pretty much a cosmic phoenix ronin.
>
> Couple of changes, your domain has changed and your faith in Sekelcuse is uplifted and instead the burdensome power of the stars is placed upon you. You also gain proficiency in martial weapons.

> **Hizigori**: Stand tall. For now you are one of the Astral Legion, Starwalker, Stormfeather, a blade of Myth. I hope that the burden does not break you. Stay true to yourself, the Enemy comes soon.<br>
**Toot**: Thank you so much, you honor me.<br>
**Hizigori**: Honor has its price. Be strong, your strength will decide the day.

Hizigori returns to guard the northern border of Creation.

### Into The Badlands

The party invites Wokou and they head off to the Badlands. As the Vizier begins opening the portal to send them off he warns them there is interference in the region and that portals had been opened nearby.

The party arrives at the base of a cliff, the top of which a black archway with inactive portal magic is found. Investigating the immediate area the find evidence of a battle that happened long ago. One so vicious that remnants still remain; demon blood, bits and pieces of broken gear and shattered weapons surround the area. This is the Rotten Wound.

Recalling back on the records of Icarus that Ahst found in Eassmere's library they show him as definitely having being there, but following the Inquisition.

> ***Eustace** True Sights the portal.<br>
**Arcadum**: You see what happened here. As you stare at the portal you can see that it opens as a bright, red light. Demons pour into the waking realm. You see them fill the sky and move across the plateau. You see the Inquisition, their lights bright, they move in together. You see an Elven ranger firing his bow. You see a proud dragonborn warrior, his brass scales shining. You see an old man blasting nearby demons. You also see... *Erin*.
>
> Your truesight reveals all, not just then but other instances.
>
> The battle expands outwards. You see random adventurers you do not recognise combating the demons flowing in and out of the portal. You see all around you the cries of the people. The stone shifts under the weight of death and blood until finally the shaled rocks fall away and the portal opens even more. You see a grand arch devil step through it, a flail in his left hand and a spear in his right, great horns. He bellows out to the dark hordes below. There you see that he faces The Seven. Their battle is intense, swirling storms of fire and destruction.
>
> You continue to watch more, until finally, you see the demons begin to trickle away. The portal becomes quiet. You see cultists standing before it, etching symbols into the forbidden stone. There you see a ranger watching from the shadow, a half-elf with long radiant red hair watching from just out of sight. Suddenly there is a flash as they disappear and reappear atop the portal watching the cultists.<br>
Each flash is like a brief veil of sunlight, then the cultists are dead. The ranger turns towards the north, then disappears in a flash of light.<br>

(Moe performs a History check rolls a nat `20`)

> **Arcadum**: The latest incursion that you heard of happened very close, within a few years of each other. One was dealt by the Inquisition, the other by the Living World. There have been other battles here, it is a commonly used place of evil that has never been fully snuffed out.

(Icarus was before the Seven, visions were newest to oldest.)

> ***Toot** flies up to get a better vantage of the area.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you start to fly, Toot, you flap your wings and become a bolt of star energy and appear at the next point.

Party heards north and finds another two gates, also dormant.

Moe decides to use his Cyclopean eye on the gates.

> **Arcadum**: You see all the things that Eustace had seen, however, there's one difference. You follow the Ranger as he shifts through light, then suddenly the ranger stops, turns in place, then aims his bow right at you, Moe. Then he asks:<br>
**Ranger**: Who goes there?!<br>
**Moe**: My name's Moe. I'm a hero from the future trying to track down what happens to you.<br>
**Ranger**: What? I'll see you fall, demon!<br>
**Arcadum**: The ranger will step through sunlight towards you.

(Moe make a Wisdom saving throw as the light enters your eye. Moe rolls `16`)

> **Arcadum**: As the light enters your eye, time becomes a circle, and the human blood of the half-elf is pulled through. The power of the Cyclops scours again and you see this man appear before you.<br>
***Ranger** waves up his bow, aims his arrow.<br>
**Ranger**: Who, what? Who are you?<br>
**Arcadum**: He will look down and you will see pieces of him are beginning to dissipate, like he is dust.

(The party is confused at this)

> **Arcadum**: You used the power of the Cyclops, which one of the things I told you is that they see time in a circle. More than that, they created the Vega by pulling what through time. And Icarus is a half-elf.

(Moe pulled the human out of him.)

> **Arcadum**: That is correct, you pulled the human through time.<br>
**Arcadum**: Icarus Sunstrider, Cardinal, manifests, and is already starting to be pulled back to his time.

**Icarus Sunstrider**<br>

> **Ahst**: Where would you leave the Sun's Passage in your last moments?<br>
**Icarus**: The sun's passage?<br>
**Ahst**: The item you use to travel through light?<br>
***Icarus** will raise up the tuft of his hair, and reveal his eye. His eye is a Yellow Square.<br>
**Ahst**: If you could choose a resting place where would it be?<br>
**Arcadum**: Icarus will turn and see something the rest of you cannot. Violet light slowly begins to shine down, The Herald watches. But a soft light begins to emanate out from Icarus. The wreathing power of Red and Gold and Blue swirls around, then emanates out, and there the symbol of the Cardinal. The light disperses. And for a brief moment Icarus solidifies and fully manifests as himself. He moves his hand across his body, then he looks at Moe, then he realizes.<br>
**Icarus**: I see. Then I am dead here.<br>
**Moe**: It's been a very long time, if that helps. I'm sorry I didn't mean to bring you here, we were just trying to find you.<br>
**Icarus**: I wonder if she's still alive.<br>
**Eustace**: Who?<br>
**Icarus**: She might be. She was timeless, after all.<br>
**Eustace**: If you have any words to pass along we could do it for you.<br>
**Icarus**: Seek my beloved, Karmine, you might know her name as. She was one of the fanged ones, from Dolten.<br>
**Moe**: We can ask.<br>
**Icarus**: If you can seek her out.<br>
**Ahst**: Of course.<br>
***Icarus** will look up at the sky.<br>
**Icarus**: I guess they failed.<br>
**Ahst**: They didn't fail. Everything everyone has done has led up to this point, in a way you're helping us succeed.<br>
**Moe**: We're trying to right the wrongs we can, that's why we sought you out.<br>
**Icarus**: In either case, you said that you sought a way to walk in the light?<br>
**Ahst**: I think so?<br>
***Icarus** will hold his hand up to his eye.<br>
**Icarus**: This is my purpose, that the last thing I would leave behind would be this.<br>
***Icarus** reveals a harmonica.<br>
**Icarus**: If you wish to walk in the light this can show you the way.<br>
***Icarus** will hand the harmonica to Ahst.

> **Arcadum**: As Ahst takes the harmonica its form will shift as time catches up. It will take its form because when Icarus dies his will no longer manifests the stone in the harmonica's shape. A stone that bears the symbol of the sun.
>
> When you look back Icarus is gone. You feel strength coming from the stone, but you can't quite translate as to what it means.

***Ahst** will sit and focus on the stone.<br>
**Arcadum**: The stone's power is unpredictable. You feel as if you could use it, but probably only once until you are able to decipher its strength, its power.<br>

(Icarus was Arcadum’s 11th character.)

(If Moe had failed the save they would have had to follow Icarus’s trail and fight through a ton of demons)

### Off To Annareth

> **Arcadum**: Normally you can only bring yourself, Moe, but not in the presence of the Sun Stone. In the presence of the Sun Stone you may bring them all.

Moe teleports everyone to the Red Star, and the session ends.
