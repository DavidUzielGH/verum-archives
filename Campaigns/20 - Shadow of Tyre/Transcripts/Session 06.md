## Relevant Lore

### Time Shenanigans

Shorty after Ahst manages to close a portal and recieves the Tane Bow, because Eustace is unconscious something special happens:

([Relevant Timestamp](https://youtu.be/PAitBR6ajiI?t=5671))

> **Arcadum**: Alright Eustace. As you float through the dream realm in your unconscious state, because of the law of refraction you find yourself floating not randomly throughout the dream, but specifically... the Violet's presence in the Dream Realm attracts your floating, dreaming form and it is awakened within the dream.<br>
You see that there is a part in the dream that appears to be an enormous whale, and within the mouth of that dream you can see a Violet Servant facing against more refracted souls. As you drift more closely, I have a very important decision that I need you to make and I need you to take some time, because what you choose to do will affect many, not just yourself.<br>
<br>
There are 3 things you can do:<br>
A - interfere with that battle<br>
B - In your awakened you can attempt to return to your body<br>
C - You can attempt to do both.<br>

Initially the group decides that `C` would be too difficult to achieve.

(It is confirmed that due to the loss of his arms, Eustace's gauntlets are also gone.)

After further debate, eventually Eustace chooses `C`; both.

> **Arcadum**: As you attempt to do both, I have more questions to ask you. You begin to conjure yourself and focus upon the two different distinct points. As you do so, the dreams are no longer as separated and begin to grow closer, and closer, and closer. And closer.<br>
(Oh, man)<br>
Eustace. Body, mind, or spirit?<br>
**Eustace**: Spirit.<br>
**Arcadum**: Water, earth, air, fire, shadow, or light?<br>
**Eustace**: I'm gonna go with water.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you begin to focus on the two points to try and aid both. The spirit of water flows in and throughout you. Your natural Genassi form, focused in on this feeling, you begin to shift. And as you do so, you suddenly find yourself walking within the Dream Realm, but in a *very special* part. Because you are a Monk, you may walk the Heavenly Path. For those that train the path of the Monk, eventually, may walk the Dream in the Waking Realm. The Heavenly Path represents two distinct points and the path between. While you are no master, you have been exposed enough to awaken the power of Ki. And thus, you begin to walk.<br>
<br>
With each step spectral trees grow around you. With each step shadows of white and black smoke rise up around you. With each step you walk through mists, pools of water, and beautiful vistas. And with each step you are closer to one of the many truths. And there you stand. For on the Heavenly Path one may reach one of the Covenants. And there you stand. Facing one of the great rings. The promises made by Lord Death. This one remains unbroken and within it you can sense the enormity of power that it holds.<br>
<br>
Your service to Babylon marks you as a lawful creature, regardless of your actual alignment, and therefore as you stand before the covenant of whose name you do not know, I give you another choice.<br>
<br>
As you stand there your will manifested and coalesced into a direct divergence upon one of the covenants you may choose a single streamed game. Once you have chosen them, they will receive the benefits that this covenant may provide.<br>
**Eustace**: Gambler's Delight.<br>
**Arcadum**: (So be it.)<br>
Alright, as you choose Gambler's Delight, you will see the visages of the past scroll before you. Specifically, you see yourselves as you were before you entered the Labyrinth of Tyre. And within that singular frame, that focus of moment, the past will change.<br>
**Party**: (Freaks out that Arcadum is doing rolls for Gambler's Delight, the campaign that ended to bring them into Shadow of Tyre)<br>
**Arcadum**: Moe. Your HP returns to 90. A third eye opens on your forehead. During this combat you may replace 3x [d20] rolls with a `20/19/16` respectively.<br>

> **Criken (Moe)**: So, from Moe's perspective did this eye just show up or has it always been there?<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, you have no idea what's going on, but knowledge fills your mind as your knowledge of Cyclopean has expanded.
**Criken (Moe)**: Can I make an arcana or history check to figure out a little more about that?<br>
**Arcadum**: Unfortunately, through the confusion of something that is new, your knowledge won't be able to reveal that.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I guess that's true, it's been 3 seconds. I wouldn't have expected him to know right away.

Later, after closing one of the Violet portals:
> **Arcadum**: Your eye flashes with insight.<br>
The first taste of your new abilities is made manifest as you continue to use them. You have the mark of the Seer. Which you have gained through your expressed knowledge of Cyclopean and your study under Xetor. Memories that you don't remember begin to flash through your mind of Xetor feeling more well than he did before. Of the amber being unsealed from his eyes and other such things. And as such, lessons that you did not know that you knew come flowing back into your mind. So, you Moe, may make two knowledge attempts per turn instead of only one.


### The Third Songblade

> **Arcadum**: The amber on that blade falls away as the weapon is unsealed.

> **Arcadum**: As the amber falls away from the blade, you will see that it is somewhat shaped like a katana. There are holes within it, which is kinda strange. And as you turn in the course of battle wind blows through it and it makes a slight whistling sound.<br>
<br>
Now. That is complete. The Heavenly Path has been walked, the covenant has been stood, and the decisions have been made.<br>
Eustace. You awaken.

The battle with the Violet Cinderous Champion continues.

### Moe's Big Question

After gaining the ability to make two knowledge checks per turn due to the new Cyclopean eye, Moe nat-20's his first (`(20) 23`) and a 19 (`19(22)`) his second against the Violet Champion.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, Moe, your mastery of your ability proved to be more than most expected. Your eye expands, widens as you study the creature. And now Criken, the heavy weight of decision making falls to you. As you are blessed with the power of the Seer, of the unsealed Amber of Xetor's eye has granted you, to some small capacity, the ability to see time as a circle not a line. And as such, I give you this one opportunity as you gaze through the Violet lens. You may ask me one question of The Enemy and I will answer it. Understand that I *will* answer it and everything attached to that answer.<br>
So, what would you like to know?

(Arcadum goes afk and the group debates what to ask.)

> **Criken (Moe)**: What does The Violet fear?<br>
**Arcadum**: (sighs)

(Arcadum changes the music: FFXIV - Answers)

The group banters about the possible end of all of Verum.

(Arcadum stop the music)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, this is what happens. Time freezes. The Violet portals close. And Moe's question echoes throughout the room.<br>
What appears before you appears through a crack in reality. A forgotten memory and a hidden secret. The last vestige of a shattered Covenant. The Source. The Truth. The Why.<br>
A woman stands before you. Ethereal. Hair like raidiant fire. She floats with a soft grace. Forward she moves towards Moe to answer his question.<br>
The Violet Servant raises its weapon...<br>
***Arcadum snaps.
**Arcadum**: ...and dissipates. The woman walks and stands before Moe. Your question echoes again, "What does The Violet fear?" and she answers:<br>
> **The Astral Traveler**: My grave.

Session Ends.
