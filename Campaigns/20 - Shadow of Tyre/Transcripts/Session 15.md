## Relevant Lore

### Great Library of Eassemere

#### Ahst's Portal Research

> **Strippin (Ahst)**: Ahst is specificially seeking a way to improve her ability to detect and manipulate portals, to have more control over her innate talent. She wants to know if she can create them, and failing that how can she improve the ability she already has.
>
> **Arcadum**: Ahst finds an odd tome that speaks of a legendary ranger by the name of Icarus. It was said that he could walk through sunlight. No one knows for certain, but the mythology seems to depict that he was able to do this by the use of an instrument that he carried at his side- that he would play at beginning of every day and it would grant him the Sun's Passage.
>
> Upon further inspection it reveals that this particular ranger was last seen at the Rotten Wound, a mountain range in the Badlands. It is believed that if one wanted to be able to walk through portals and open them themselves then one could do so through the Sun.
>
> The instrument is revealed to be a harmonica.

#### Toot's Genesis Seed Research

>**Toot**: (*mimicry*) Do you have a Genesis Seed?
>
> **Alex (Toot)**: Toot is just trying to find more information on how to find more Genesis Seeds or anything entailing them.<br>
**Arcadum**: Let's try to narrow this down. Do you want to know where they can be found? What they can be used in, ingredients-wise? Or famous times they have been used?<br>
**Alex (Toot)**: Let's start with where they can be found.<br>
**Arcadum**: Genesis seeds are reportedly to be found in the remnants of where the World Tree once was, deep within The Rift.

> **Alex (Toot)**: What about some of the famous uses?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is rumored that Genesis Seeds are a concentration of manifested Lifestream. And that they can be used to produce all sorts of amazing pieces of life. It is rumored that the first races were created by one. It that the once fertile soil of Kalkatesh was actually given life by the planting of the World Seed, which is a special Genesis Seed that was larger than the rest, perhaps more pure than the rest were.

> **Alex (Toot)**: Are there any other ways to use the Genesis Seeds?<br>
**Arcadum**: Genesis Seeds can be used in the following manners: They can be used to actually reinvigorate a land and heal it of sickness, like the entirity of land of curses or whatever. It can be used to create life in its actual form, like a race. It can be used to bring someone back from dead as a true resurrection. And, the big one, it can be used to create some of the most potent elixirs ever heard of.

#### Ahst's Scrolls of Indikar Research

> **Ahst**: Do you have anything on the Scrolls of Nedakar(her pronunciation)?<br>
**Arcadum**: Just to be sure, what was your source of knowledge on that?<br>
**Strippin (Ahst)**: We were given a poem by Derk Darkwater to seek the Scrolls of Nedakar hidden in the wizard's labyrinth.

> ***Arcadum** slams open a cabinet and pulls out the deep notes.<br>
**Arcadum**: The Scrolls of Indikar speak of a very strange ritual. It speaks of a ritual that requires five and within its center appears to be an orange light. Going further it would seem, the scrolls, apparently, are some sort of instructional ritual about a process known as "False Refraction".

#### Ahst's Hall of Mirrors / Changeling Research

Ahst asks about the Hall of Mirrors in Eassemere.

> **Strippin (Ahst)**: When we deciphered the Tapestry of Fate it said "Within us the infinite walks, the Twin Snakes hold sway, seek thee the Hall of Mirrors." and it gave us coordinates to the Hall of Mirrors in Eassmere.

> **Arcadum**: The book that you find depicts, ironically, the anthology of your own race. It explains the history of the Hags and the Changelings and their ancient, sort of, cursed existence. How a Hag will have a changeling, will set her out into the world in order to corrupt as many people as possible, to collect as many faces as possible, before being returned to the Hags to be transformed into one of them again. Giving up their free will, sacrificing themselves towards the Coven, and then taking all the faces, all the power and refractions, and all of the essence that they have reaped, and bringing them into the central of power. This reveals to you the true purpose of the Hags birthing of Changelings and why *you* even exist.
>
> But there is something else, hidden just beyond. Just beyond this disturbing history there is something else that is written. As it turns out, you have a brother. Just one, as all Changelings do, and his name is Tomen. And you see that there is a visage of a mirror with a twin-headed serpent.
>
> The Hags, in an attempt to fix their misshapen souls, needed a method in which to gather souls and to refract them. The Hags didn't realize this is what they were doing, the book explains. That the risk behind refraction is so much more powerful and so farther reaching than something as simple and as vain as to no longer be ugly. But, that’s what the Hags were trying to do. They were trying to get their youth back, as they had achieved immortality but not eternal youth. In their original plan they thought the way to do it would be to inject their essence into their prototyped specimen and to spread it as much as possible.
>
> By sacrificing most of themselves, which is why there are few Hags left- essentially the Hag race, which used to be a country off the coast of Orde, in order ensure that at least some of them would have eternal youth they drew lots, and those that failed sacrificed themselves for the rest of their sisters, and it was from this massive sacrifice of Hag souls, and powers, and lives that Tomen was created.
>
> Now, Tomen was originally made male, because the idea was that they wanted as many offspring as possible, and the male could spread offspring more quickly than a female could. Unfortunately, something that they did not anticipate was that because all of the Hags were women their rituals did not work on Tomen, who is male. So the very hubris of their action became their downfall, and Tomen betrayed the Hag race, and created the Mirror realm. Or discovered it, it’s not really clear which he did. He has basically used it as a place to hide his sisters he could find before he was sealed away.
>
> The book says that Tomen is yet still sealed away guarded by the serpents that once served him.

> **Arcadum**: And that's why Changelings are sent out into the world before being called back, because your purpose is to copy as many faces as possible. To gather as much essence as possible, so that when you come back ripe and swollen with these memories and powers that you've stolen you would transform into a Hag and that power rejoins the Coven.
>
> The weird thing about the Hall of Mirrors in this book is that it references it not just as a place but as state of being. Like it references it as a place you can go, but also a place you think of. The book switches back and forth on usage. So you're not sure if it's literally a place or does it mean a place in your mind? Perhaps a Nirvana state? It's also written in prose to it's not very straightforward.

#### Moe's Possession Research

> **Moe**: (*drunk*) Do you have any information on determining if a subject is possesed and how to remove possession and/or entitites that exist within the subconscious of a subject's mind?
>
> See my wife, she has a thing in her brain and I'm trying to fix it.

> **Criken (Moe)**: Moe tries to recall the sensation he felt when he was peering through his wife's mind and could sense that other presence. He's hoping that through his abilities that he can find a way to identify if there is a presence and how to isolate it and potentially extract it.

> **Arcadum**:The book you uncover about possession specifically tells you many different methods of possession; that there is spiritual possession, essence possession, emotional, literal posession, etc. As you study more and more on the subject you begin to uncover not just different pieces of possession but more importantly how to detect if somebody is possessed. And as it turns out, there is a way to do that.
>
> And that brings you to a piece of lore

> The Nomadic Half-Elves reinvision the Elven runes that used to protect their lords and refashioned them into dream catchers. These strange devices can be used to detect if someone is possessed or not.
>
> Continuing your research, what you're able to discover is that dreamcatchers don't catch dreams as their names may depict, what they do however is act as a repelling ward. A shield, a protective bubble and the more intricate the design the stronger the bubble and the wider the bubble might be. They're more along the lines of a filter than anything.

(LITERALLY LEYLINIC SHELL PROTECTION?)

[Gambler's Delight -- Session 03](../../16%20-%20Gambler's%20Delight/Transcripts/Session%2003.md) - Dreamcatcher notes:
  * Toot rolls a 15 religion to investigate dreamcatcher
  * Dreamcatcher is older than the religion of Oun, Wode, and the dream.
  * Radiates a spiritual, hallowed, energy.
  * Toot doesn’t touch dreamcatcher.

---

Moe continues on to ask specifically about removing someone already posessed as Dreamcatchers are preventative, not prescriptive:

> **Criken (Moe)**: Extraction of a passenger in a mind. Yea, exorcism pretty much.

> **Arcadum**: As you start to research on how to do that you find some basic tomes on how to remove spirits, such as using priest, and paladins and things like that. But, if you're looking for something more sexy on how to do that...<br>
(Oh, I guess that's true. Fuck that's not good...)<br>
Well, okay. You find informatino on a material known as Soul Stone. Which is rumored to be the bones of Outsiders that has been grated and refined down to its base self.<br>
In fact, you see that Soul Stone has the ability to store souls within it. Both the draining and releasing of them. And in addition to that, there is a small reference here that this particular material was used to create the H'kari's armor.

> **Criken (Moe)**: Where can I find Soul Stones?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is said that the Soul Stones can only be refined by those that can summon Outsiders and actually bind and release them. It is also rumored that the Vega could make Soul Stones.

Moe drunkenly asks the library about the Vega -- Vega section is restricted. He presents his pass and is granted temporary access.

Eustace, Raost, and Wokou arrive and pre-empt any further research until later.

### The Hall of Mirrors

The party departs the Library and heads off to the Hall of Mirrors after asking Wokou to guide them.

On the way in, Toot looks up at the ceiling and it is revealed that it is mirrored.

#### Tapestry Room

Tapestry titled "Astral Outpost":
> **Arcadum**: As you take a closer look at the tapestry, it appears to be some sort of building in the Astral Sea. It's really strange, it seems to just sit there in the middle of nothing. You see that it appears to be somewhat like a tower and there are some branches of other floating pieces of rock. And curiously enough, you can see there is a glowing red light in the center of it.
    
> ***Raost** takes a close look at red light<br>
**Arcadum**: You see that there is a red glowing symbol:<br>
***Arcadum** draws the symbol<br>

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oI7X1wO.png" alt="Strange Symbol in Tapestry" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/oI7X1wO.png)

> **Arcadum**: The symbol is glowing with a red light on what appears to be a floating visage in the Astral Sea.

> **Criken (Moe)**: It's not the same as the symbol on [Moe's] armor?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is not.

Moe is called over. However, this is not a tapestry of the Red Star of Annereth. It looks completely different. But the symbol is a sign that he feels has something to do with the handmaidens, but isn't sure why.

Looking around they find there is a signature at the bottom of the tapestry. The signature is written in a language none understand, however, Derk added translations at some point. The signature has the name `Valeer` on it. As it turns out Valeer made all of the tapestries in this room.

Eventually, Moe uses his Cyclopean eye and Eustace true-sights the tapestry:
> **Arcadum**: As you stare at the symbol you see that its light glows bright amongst the tapestry, and you can see the Astral Sea sparkle just beyond. Almost like you're actually looking there, in a way.

Moe drunkenly calls "Portal Girl" over and as Ahst looks over the tapestry she detects the "Astral Outpost" tapestry is in fact a portal.
> **Arcadum**: As you look into the tapestry it seems their suspicions are correct. This is a portal. However, a cold sweat breaks out across your skin as this is not just any portal. This is a powerful portal. You feel the energy emanating on the other side. It's a masterfully made portal, not a single bit of the energy is wasted, leaked, or lost in any way.<br>
But, you believe that this is not a portal to a place within Kalkatesh.<br>
It may be that the presented landmark is real.

(Arcana check, highest is a `19` from Moe)

> **Arcadum**: Congratulations. You have found one of the hidden pieces of the end game. Because of your actions the heroes of Kalkatesh are now one step closer to successfully filling the requirements and parameters of March 31st, 2021. You have uncovered the gate to the Twilight Station.

Writing hidden in the tapestry in Portalish Chalk names it as a portal to the Twilight Station.

#### Toot's Question

This discovery triggers a violet action. And due to Toot's presence as the Violet Eye, The Herald reaches out.<br>
Toot uses his birthday [1d20r20] (guaranteed nat-`20`) to resist (`(20+6)==>26`), which triggers a free question to Arcadum.

> **Arcadum**: With a `26`, Toot, you hold your ground. You feel a sudden burst of power from your eye. You hold up your wing trying to cover it, your eyepatch is ripped out as the power tries to break free, but you cover your eye in time and focus it back and focus it down.
>
> And now we get to play a special game. Just you and me. Not only have you rolled high enough to resist my pull, but you have rolled high enough to take a little back from me. So, Toot, what would you like to know? No restrictions.

Clarification is requested on repercussions of the question Toot may ask:

> **Arcadum**: As one of the Seven Eyes, he has the most resistence out of anyone else when asking these kinds of questions. So if anyone was going to gamble it should be one of the Seven Eyes, but that does not guarantee him saftey. It does not grant him immunity. If you ask the wrong question terrible things may still happen.

The group debates a number of options OOC before Alex asks for a bit of clarification:

> **Alex (Toot)**: In character what exactly is happening to Toot that he's able to ask this question?
>
> **Arcadum**: Essentially, your mind as Toot, not with the curse of speech, but your actual mind, your thoughts and your abilities to handle actual stuff is the part I'm talking to, first of all. Second of all, whenever The Herald tried enforce its will and look through your eye and you resisted, it faulterd and you caught it on the backstep. So, before it can recede from your mind you can reach out and grab a piece of its knowledge instead.

(Effectively, because of The Herald's connection to The Enemy this question can even be answered by The Enemy directly. Or rather, the information could be that which The Herald knows, but is from The Enemy originally.)

After hearing this, they finally arrive at what they believe to be a simple enough and in-character question:

> **Toot**: Why do you keep attacking us?

> **Arcadum**: So be it. One moment while I calculate. This may take some time.<br>
**Strippin (Ahst)**: Do we see anything happening to Toot during this?<br>
**Arcadum**: Absolutely, you can see an explosion of violet light come from his eye. I'll be right back. I have to check the deep notes.

---

> **Arcadum**: Alex, prepare yourself. Everyone else please be quiet while I talk to Alex.

> **Arcadum**: You ask a simple question that carries with it so much meaning. And for a brief moment you are no longer Toot. You are no longer a Kenku. You are no longer an Eye. But, you are something else. You fall through a Violet light and you instead find yourself in another place *at another time*.
>
> You fall through the Astral Sea.<br>
Piece by piece.<br>
Bit by bit.<br>
>
> Flowing, going, swirling and breaking. You fly past a tower, it deconstructs. Another tower, it deconstructs. Another tower, it deconstructs. Another tower, it deconstructs. And a final tower and it deconstructs.
>
>The wheel reverses. It spins and swirls, until on the other side, far away from all things, you find yourself working alongside a few other smiling men, whose backs are bowed, and their brows are wet with sweat. But they are happy. They lay the stone onto the road paving it and building it. And your hands are with them. You turn, you see the silhouette of a woman wave to you. You return her wave, before the scene shatters like reality. Glass and broken.<br>
Violet light etches on the edge, swirling like a dark storm. *Hate* fills you. A hate of all things. A hate of yourself more than any other. And the pumping, twisting feeling becomes silent. You watch it all now. From the edge of creation. From the edge of a failed existence. And there, the garish tree shows you its falsehood. And as Death guards it- you had broken him before, you would do it again. As many times as it takes. And you will finally have your *peace*.
>
> Toot awakens on the marble floor burdened with terrible knowledge. The Eye glows bright, it swirls with might, and The Herald watches.
>
> Toot will speak. "I saw things."

Toot did not speak those initial words, Arcadum spoke them for him. The group is shocked Toot spoke normally.

> ***Eustace** true-sight's Toot.<br>
**Arcadum**: Eustace, the curse is gone. Consumed by a greater burden.

However, due to this new "burden" Toot's Kenku curse is overridden and can speak "freely"/normally.

#### Twilight Station Tapestry

In looking back over at the "Astral Outpost" tapestry after Toot's question:
> **Arcadum**: In the distance of the perspective you once held in the [tapestry], where there was once nothing there is now the point of Violet light.

The group gains an understandable concern about The Enemy or The Herald knowing about or being able to get to this all-important item. Strippin thinks to ask if Ahst may have enough portal knowledge to know if there would be risk of something coming out of this portal or if it is one-way.

(Ahst makes an arcana check: `14`)

> **Arcadum**: With a `14` you don't think that [the tapestry portal to the Twilight Station is] two-way, but it still has a lingering effect. A powerful adversary could force the opening the other way.

#### Remaining Tapestries
A tapestry titled "Abandoned Town" - They never inspected it.

A tapestry titled "Strange Ship":
> **Arcadum**: You recognize the ship of the Pirate King himself. Red-Eyes Raymond and his ship known as Unfortunate Circumstance.

A tapestry titled "Remains of Great Beasty":
> **Arcadum**: Under the tapestry is written: "Remains of Dov'Na'Ka"

(One thing to note is all of these tapestries appear to have some relation to names of potential and/or past Phase Bosses)
