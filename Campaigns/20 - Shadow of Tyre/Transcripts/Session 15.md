## Relevant Lore

### Great Library of Eassemere

#### Toot's Genesis Seed Research

Genesis seeds found in the remnants of world tree once was. Deep within the rift. Seeds rumored to be a concentration of concentrated lifestream. can make all sorts of life, such as races, or the soil of kalkatesh. Kalkatesh is rumored to be created by world seed, larger genesis seed.

> **Toot**: Are there any other ways to use genesis seeds?<br>
**Arcadum**: Reinvigorate land, heal it of sickness, curses whatever. Used to create life in its actual form, like a race. Can be used to bring someone back from dead as a true resurrection. It can be used to create some of the most potent elixirs ever heard of.

#### Ahst's Scrolls of Indakar (sp?) Research

> **Ahst**: Seek the scrolls of Nedaka (sp?) hidden in the wizard's labyrinth.<br>
***Arcadum** slams open a cabinet and pulls out the deep notes<br>
**Arcadum**: Scrolls of Indikar (sp?) speak of a very strange ritual. A ritual that requires 5, and within its center appears to be an orange light. Going further it would seem, the scrolls, apparently, are some sort of instructional ritual. A process known as false refraction.

#### Ahst's Hall of Mirrors / Changeling Research

Ahst asks about the Hall of Mirrors in Eassemere. The Tapestry of Fate said seek out twin snakes within the halls of mirrors in Eassemere.

> **Arcadum**: The book that you find depicts, ironically, the anthology of your own race. It explains the history of the Hags and the Changelings, and their ancient, sort of, cursed existence. How a Hag will have a changeling, will set her out into the world in order to corrupt as many people as possible. To collect as many faces as possible, before being returned to the Hags to be transformed into one of them again. Giving up their free will, sacrificing themselves towards the Coven, and then taking all the faces, all the power and refractions, and all of the essence that they have reaped, and bringing them into the central of power. This reveals to you the true purpose of the Hags birthing of Changelings, and why you even exist.<br>
<br>
But there is something else, hidden just beyond. Just beyond this disturbing history there is something else that is written. As it turns out, you have a brother. Just one, as all Changelings do, and his name is Tomen. And you see that there is a visage of a mirror with a twin-headed serpent.<br>
<br>
The Hags, in an attempt to fix misshapen souls, needed a method in which to gather souls and refract them. The Hags didn't realize this is what they were doing, that the risk behind refraction is so much more powerful, and so farther reaching than something as simple and as vain as to no longer be ugly. But, that’s what the Hags were trying to do. They were trying to get their youth back, as they had achieved immortality but not eternal youth. In their original plan they thought the way to do it would be to inject their essence into prototyped specimen and to spread it as far as possible. By sacrificing most of themselves, which is why there are few Hags left.<br>
Essentially the Hag race, which used to be a country off the coast of Orde, in order ensure that at least some of them would have eternal youth they drew lots, and those that failed sacrificed themselves for the rest of their sisters, and it was from this massive sacrifice of Hag souls, and powers, and lives that Tomen was created.<br>
<br>
Now, Tomen was originally made male. Because the idea was that they wanted as many offspring as possible, and the male could spread offspring more quickly than a female could. Unfortunately something that they did not anticipate was that because all of the Hags were women, their rituals did not work on Tomen, who is male. So the very hubris of their action became their downfall, and Tomen betrayed the Hag race, and created the Mirror realm. Or discovered it, it’s not really clear which he did. He has basically used it as a place to hide the sisters he could find, before he was sealed away.<br>
<br>
The book says that Tomen is yet still sealed away, guarded by the serpents that once served him.


References the hall of mirrors as a place and state of being. As a place you can go, but also a place you can think of. The book switches back and forth on usage.

#### Moe's Possession Research

Initially Moe asks about how to extract a possession from someone's mind, with his wife Beatorix in mind. The first bit of information to come back is on Dreamcatchers and the protection they offer:

> Nomadic half-elves refashioned runes that protect lords into dream catchers. Repelling ward, shield, protective bubble. More intricate the design stronger the bubble, wide the bubble.

(LITERALLY LEYLINIC SHELL PROTECTION)

Gambler's Delight -- Session 03 - Dreamcatcher notes:
  * Toot rolls a 15 religion to investigate dreamcatcher
  * Dreamcatcher is older than the religion of Oun, Wode, and the dream.
  * Radiates a spiritual, hallowed, energy.
  * Toot doesn’t touch dreamcatcher.

Moe continues on to ask specifically about removing someone already posessed as Dreamcatchers are preventative, not prescriptive:

> **Moe**: Extraction of a passenger in a mind, exorcism pretty much.

> **Arcadum**: Exorcism via priest/paladin.<br>
(Well, I guess that's true. Fuck that's not good...)<br>
Soul Stone, rumored to be the bones of outsiders that is grated and refined down to its base self.<br>
Soul Stones have the capability to store souls within it, draining and releasing. This particular material was used to create the H'kari's armor.

Begins at 6:08 -- Confirm "capability to store souls within it, draining and releasing"

> **Moe**: Where to find Soul Stones?<br>
**Arcadum**: Soul stones can only be found by those that can summon outsiders, and those that can bind and release them. Also rumored that the Vega could make soul stones.

Moe further requests information from the magically automated library about the Vega -- Vega section is restricted.

#### Needs Catagorizing -- Further Notes

Begins 5:34 - Icarus and the Sun's Passage. Last seen at the Rotten Wound, a mountain range in the Badlands.

### Hall of Mirrors

(Ceiling is mirrored)

#### Tapestry Room

Tapestry titled "Astral Outpost":
  * Appears to be a building in the Astral Sea. Appears to sit there in the middle of nothing, somewhat like a tower, and there are some branches of other floating pieces of rock. Can see a glowing red light in the center of it.
    
Raost takes a close look at red light:
> **Arcadum**: You see that there is a red glowing symbol.<br>
***Arcadum** draws symbol of translators/Taladon (circle triangle square circle). The symbol is glowing.

Moe is called over, and the symbol reminds Moe of the handmaidens.

There is a signature at the bottom of the tapestry. The signature has the name `Valeer` on it. Valeer made all of the tapestries.

Moe uses his Cyclopean eye and Eustace true-sights the tapestry:
> **Arcadum**: As you stare at the symbol you see that its light glows bright amongst the tapestry, and you can see the astral sea sparkle just beyond. Almost like you're actually looking at it like you're there.

Ahst detects the "Astral Outpost" tapestry is a portal.
> **Arcadum**: However, a cold sweat breaks out across your skin, this is a powerful portal. You feel the energy emanating on the other side, a masterfully made portal, no energy leaked or wasted.<br>
This is not a portal to a place within Kalkatesh.<br>
It may be that the presented landmark is real.

(Arcana check, highest is a 19 from Moe)

> **Arcadum**: Congratulations you have found one of the hidden pieces of the end game. The heroes of Kalkatesh are now one step closer to successfully filling the requirements and parameters of March 31st 2021. You have uncovered the gate to the Twilight Station.

Writing hidden in the tapestry in Portalish Chalk naming it as a portal to the Twilight Station.

Discovery triggers a violet action via Toot as the Violet Eye. Toot uses his birthday [1d20r20] (guaranteed nat-20) to resist, which triggers a free question to Arcadum.

The group debates a number of options OOC before finally arriving at what they believe to be a simple enough question:

> **Toot**: Why do you keep attacking us?

> **Arcadum**: So be it. One moment while I calculate, this might take some time.

> **Group**: Do we see anything happening to Toot during this?

> **Arcadum**: You can see an explosion of violet light come from his eye. I'll be right back. I have to check the deep notes.

> **Arcadum**: Alex, prepare yourself. Everyone else please be quiet while I talk with alex. Alright.

> **Arcadum**: You ask a simple question, that carries with it so much meaning. And for a brief moment, you are no longer Toot, you are no longer a Kenku, you are no longer an Eye, but you are something else. You fall through a Violet light, and you instead find yourself in another place, at another time.
>
> You fall through the Astral Sea.<br>
Piece by piece.<br>
Bit by bit.<br>
>
> Flowing, going, swirling and break. You fly past a tower, it deconstructs. Another tower, it deconstructs. Another tower, it deconstructs. It deconstructs. And a final tower, and it deconstructs.
>
>The wheel reverses, it spins and swirls, until on the other side, far away from all things, you find yourself working alongside a few other smiling men, whose backs are bowed, and their brows are wet with sweat. But they are happy. They lay the stone onto the road, paving it and building it. And your hands are with them. You turn, you see the silhouette of a woman wave to you. You return her wave, before the scene shatters like reality. Glass, and broken.<br>
Violet light etches on the edge, swirling like a dark storm. *Hate* fills you, hate of all things. A hate of yourself, more than any other. And the pumping, twisting feeling, becomes silent. You watch it all now. From the edge of creation. From the edge of a failed existence. And there, the garish tree shows you its falsehood. As Death guards it. You had broken him before, you would do it again. As many times as it takes. And you will finally have your *peace*.
>
> Toot awakens on the marble floor burdened with terrible knowledge. The eye glows bright, it swirls with might, and the Herald watches.
>
> Toot will speak. "I saw things."

(Toot did not speak those initial words, Arcadum spoke them for him. Later revealed to be The Enemy speaking through him. However, due to this new curse Toot's Kenku curse is overridden and can speak "freely"/normally. However, they are not aware of this IC.)

In looking back over at the "Astral Outpost" tapestry:
> **Arcadum**: In the distance of the perspective you once held in the [tapestry], where there was once nothing there is now the point of violet light.

The group gains an understandable concern about The Enemy or The Herald knowing about or being able to get to this all-important item. Strippin thinks to ask if Ahst may have enough portal knowledge to know if there would be risk of something coming out of this portal or if it is one-way.

(Ahst makes an arcana(?) check)

> **Arcadum**: With a 14 you don't think that [the tapestry portal to Twilight Station is] two-way, but it still has a lingering effect. A powerful adversary could force the opening the other way.

The remaining tapestries are examined:
* Tapestry titled "Abandoned Town"
* Tapestry titled "Strange Ship" - Red eyes Raymond, ship known as unfortunate circumstance.
* Tapestry titled "Remains of Great Beasty" / "Remains of Dov'Na'Ka"

(One thing to note is all of these tapestries appear to have some relation to names of potential and/or past Phase Bosses)

OH I JUST REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT WEAVERS ARE NOW<br>
<br>
**Pebbles** 10/17/2020 at 10:02 PM EST<br>
Dude. The enemy is from a failed reality. Weavers. Seeds, and the other roles. Can help rebirth that other reality. and possibly revive the enemy's love<br>
<br>
**Jonah Three-Rivers (Saitken)** 10/17/2020 at 10:03 PM EST<br>
Also thanks for realizing why becoming a weaver was y'know, kind of world savingly important
