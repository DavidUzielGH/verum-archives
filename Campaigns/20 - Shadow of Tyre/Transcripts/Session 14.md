### Touching Your Own Refraction

While visiting Eassmere, The City of Wonders, Roast shakes hands with one of the leaaders of the city, his refraction, Inuchiyo. They are brought to a place of pure white.

> **Arcadum**: You appear in a place that seems strange. A place upon the edge of existence. It is here in this place that you and Inuchiyo are suspended. Suspended in a place that neither is nor is not. And you are neither of them, but you are you. A floating orb of desire and need.
>
> So, let me explain how this works. You are the soul. That is, you, Woops. So now, we get to explain one of the secrets of refraction. You are in the place where refractions are determined. You are at a place simply referred to as “The Edge.” You are currently not roleplaying you, "Woops in the game", but rather the collection of your experience as a player. So, therefore, you have access to all knowledge and all inclinations of every character that you have ever played. However, in this place your space is limited in its manipulation. In fact, being here is already a revelation that overwhelms your sense of self. Because the white that you see is not a blank space, but rather it is the space of all. It is the Edge. You can see around you all of the spirits of every player that I’ve ever ran for, curled and shifting together in an endless ebb and flow. And since you are the first to touch your own refraction, your soul pops free. And you see what no one else has seen. And there, in the distance, you see a hooded man.

(Tate does a dumb)

> **Arcadum**: There is a hooded figure that presides over them all. You can see with a single hand it seems to shift the ebb and the flow of the souls. What do you do?<br>
**Woops (Raost)**: Who are you?<br>
**Arcadum**: When you attempt to speak, you don’t speak, but rather, your intention ripples across the edge. And the hooded creature turns slowly and looks at you.

> **Hooded Figure**: I am many things. You are an anomaly, risen above the others.

> **Arcadum**: It looks at you.<br>
**Woops (Raost)**: I try to go towards it.<br>
**Arcadum**: You begin to move towards it and as you do so the creature will look up into the sky.

> **Hooded Figure**: Allow me. Stand before me soul and be judged.
>
> I see. So it is upon us then. Unfortunate. Hail to thee, little life. I am death. That is the name, at least, that I have been called. But I am more and I am less. My visage has been seen before, but never in this. There are many aspects to the facet of myself and you have found your way to The Edge; to the forbidden space, where I may yet walk the path.

> **Woops (Raost)**: Can I see my soul still there? Can I see Raost and Inuchiyo?<br>
**Arcadum**: You see them floating there, but you also see *everything*.<br>
**Woops (Raost)**: I’ll look back to my characters and say, “They’re not done yet. I need to get back to them.”

> **Hooded Figure**: A mortal soul. Always forward. Always watchful. You will have your part to play in what is to come. You are the first to break free of the mold. Perhaps this iteration will be the last. I suppose we will see. Turn your gaze behind you.

> **Woops (Raost)**: I’ll turn around.

> **Hooded Figure**: Do you see it? Look deeply. It comes for us all.

(The map background turns pure Violet)

> **Hooded Figure**: Return to your vessel. For each turning of the wheel I grow weaker to stop it.

> **Woops (Raost)**: I rush to my characters. I try to protect them.<br>
**Arcadum**: Something stops you.

> **Hooded Figure**: Impossible! Life must return to its vessel.<br>
**Mysterious Voice**: You’re running out of time! I can almost walk *here*.

> ***Arcadum** snaps.
**Arcadum**: And then you return to yourself.<br>
**Woops (Raost)**: Which one?<br>
**Arcadum**: Indeed. Let’s find out, shall we?<br>
