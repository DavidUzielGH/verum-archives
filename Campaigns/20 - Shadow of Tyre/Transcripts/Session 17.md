# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 17

Aired: 10/31/2020

Now back in Tyre's Labyrinth, they arrive back where they previously left following the fight with Babylon's "Punishment Squad", but this time with Mirage in tow.

## Relevant Lore

### Ahst's Songblade

> **Arcadum**: You fully attune to Songblade, and as such you will be able to enact its hidden lifestrand abilities.<br>
You can spend and store strands, and can have up to 3 strands. By spending a bonus action, and a strand, you may manifest a single echo hidden within the blade, this works similarly to the Critical Image, but lasts only one round.

Replenished during long rest.

### The "Branch" of Yggdrasil

Mirage visits the tree and places her hand upon it:
> **Arcadum**: As you get closer to the tree you can feel its connection to the great wheel of the lifestream. It flows directly through each finger as you place your palm against it. It is like a heartbeat, it is like a vein of life.<br>
It is through this that you are able to feel the different parts of Tyre's labyrinth.
>
> Make a Nature check, Mirage. `13(11)`
>
> As you place your hand upon this tree you can feel its different pieces and sections within the labyrinth. Specifically there are five pieces of the tree that can be accessed.<br>
Here's what you know: There is a place of serenity, suffering, heat, silence, and death.<br>
**Party**: Are we in one of those areas right now?<br>
**Arcadum**: You are not.<br>
The other ones are emotional connections she has through the tree. The current one does not have a label, as you're here.

### Remainder of the First Floor

#### Western Room:

Stone arches, and what appears to be an altar that has not been used in some time.

> **Arcadum**: A set of great stone arches that almost form a complete circle.<br>
A radiating stone in the center giving off soft, pale, green magic.<br>
The altar has the symbology of the Green pantheon.

(Group fails the Nature check on the altar.)

Raost investigates the strange stone in the center of the stone pillars:
> **Arcadum**: The stone begins to float as you approach it.<br>
As the stone floats before you you begin to see that it is etched in visages of nature, but not of this world. Not of the land of Kalkatesh, but another place entirely. And slowly, you begin to see tiny vestiges depart themselves from the stones flesh, and as it does so pieces of the stone begin to shift and change like pieces of a story, and with each gust of wind it all rearranges. You sense that the stone is made not of Kalkatesh, but of the land your body has repurposed itself. This stone is from Ori.<br>
***Raost** will reach out and touch the stone.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you reach out and place your hand upon the stone, you can feel something within it stir, almost as if there is something inside of it.<br>
**Raost**: Holy shit is it an egg?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes, it is.<br>

Ahst explores the far west side of the room:
> **Arcadum**: You can see an old fountain that is shattered and broken. There appears to be remnants of an experiment. There are pieces of stone peeled back in such a manner, they appear to be somewhat like eggshell.

Eustace will truesight the egg Raost is standing next to:
> **Arcadum**: Okay. As you have activated the stone, and under the unique circumstance, god the unique circumstance, of having a being that is infused of the power and essence of Ori means that you awaken the stone, and not only do you awaken the stone, you have revealed that is in fact an egg. And even more important than that, at this time the heroes of Kalkatesh have 18 Order, and as such, you may if you so choose, spend order to hatch this egg. If you do so you will awaken a great ally for the hero of Kalkatesh.<br>
**Party**: How much Order?
**Arcadum**: 4 Order.

(The group will spend the Order and hatch the egg)

> **Arcadum**: The stone begins to crack, it shifts, and bursts open. A white spiritual light will flow out like water from cracked stone, and like a river wash over Raost, and over all those present. And as it does so, something will form from the radiating energy. Piece by piece it forms the visage of a dragon.

#### Hizigori Zokitai - The Myth of the North

The creature will speak:
> **Dragon**: Such are strange tidings to find myself washed ashore of a land so distant, and yet so familiar.<br>
**Raost**: What language is this creature speaking?<br>
**Arcadum**: This creature is not speaking a language, but rather, it is speaking Meaning. This particular creature has a very rare ability in the universe of Verum, it has Absolute Speech. Every creature understands what it says, as long as it has sentience. This language is known as *Supernal*.<br>
**Raost**: Welcome to Kalkatesh.<br>
**Dragon**: Familial tides many share, but perhaps even greater is a family that one chooses.<br>
**Arcadum**: His laughter is like ringing bells, and reassuring hands.<br>
**Dragon**: In either case, my visage into this world was long since sealed. Where is the caretaker Tyre?
**Raost**: He’s gone now.
**Dragon**: Yes. I can feel the disdain within your hearts.<br>
***Raost** will take out the key and hold it in his hands, not offering it to him, just showing it.<br>
**Dragon**: Yes. Then you are here to claim what he has left behind. It would seem that I owe him more thanks than I knew. Tell me, is there not a grave to mourn?<br>
**Raost**: I think this is about the best you’ve got.<br>
***Raost** will hold the key higher.<br>
**Dragon**: I did my best to warn him. The day he came to Ori I tried to speak with him, to the fables. But his eyes are human, and time is always against them. There must always be a Traitor, it was his lot. It was his cost.<br>
**Ahst**: What do you mean?<br>
**Dragon**: Understanding has yet to reach you. That is fine. For the teachings are difficult, and they are fragile, for they must survive each iteration, and with each iteration less do. A soul is such a strong, but such a fragile thing.<br>
**Moe**: You've been through multiple iterations?<br>
**Dragon**: Yes. It was I that spake unto the first of the translators. My king sought to face the Enemy. To outlast him, as dragons do.<br>
**Ahst**: Wait, you taught the translators?

> **Hizigori**: I am Hizigori Zokitai, but you may call me Hiz, if you like. It is what they always called me.<br>
**Raost**: I'm Raost and these are my friends.<br>
The world’s in a lot of trouble right now, and I really think we could use some time picking your brain.<br>
**Hizigori**: Yes it is, but you're not doing so poorly yourself. There is yet much Order I sense. The Entropy comes, and the Enemy has yet to truly show its strength, but there is Hope yet. And while there is Hope our worlds may yet still stand.<br>
**Raost**: Will you help us?<br>
**Hiz**: Of course, for I already have.<br>
**Party**: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Hiz.<br>

> **Hizigori**: I can feel the questions within your mind brim, speak them and know peace.<br>
**Moe**: Could you tell me more of the role the Shapers have in this? You know the language that is universal. As someone that deals with language I'd like to know as much as you can tell.<br>
**Hizigori**: The language that I speak is the first language, my friend. From feeling was first given form, it is the language spoken by the oldest of beings. But I cannot teach it to you, for it is also the language of the Enemy.<br>
**Raost**: What can you tell us of the Enemy that we already know.<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will take a long look at Raost.<br>
**Hizigori**: Many things, but I wonder can the Eye bear it?<br>
***Hizigori** will look toward Toot.<br>
***Toot** hides a little.<br>
**Moe**: We could use your guidance on something, as you see our friend has been afflicted by a curse of the Enemy without risk of allowing the Enemy to talk through him, do you know how we can cure him?<br>
**Hiz**: Bring him before me.<br>
***Toot** walks forward.<br>
**Hizigori**: You poor creature. Many curses assault your form, there is much pain that your people bear. I cannot take away that pain, but perhaps this could be done.<br>

> **Arcadum**: The dragon Hizigori will breathe deeply, and will use his breath weapon.<br>
***Hizigori** will breathe the essence of the old Myths directly onto Toot, and as this happens the power will surge through Toot, nearly destroying him. However, Hizigori is a kind soul, and remakes Toot back to his proper form, flaws and all, except for one flaw. A Violet light will be pulled free from Toot's body.

(First language being spoken by the Violet light)<br>
(First language being spoken by Hiz)<br>
(Presumed fight of Power Words between the two entities ensues...)

As the final words are spoken the Violet light is gone.

> **Hizigori**: Speak freely, my friend.<br>
**Toot**: Are you sure it's okay for me to speak?<br>
**Hizigori**: Yes.<br>
***Toot** falls to the ground and starts crying.
**Toot**: Finally, after being cursed for all my life, it was finally broken. Only to find out it was a lie and I was cursed with something greater…<br>
***Toot** faces the dragon.<br>
**Toot**: Thank you so much, I'm forever grateful to you.<br>
**Arcadum**: The dragon will simply smile. There is no judgement, or shame, or expectation within such a smile. Only a soft, but firm, affirmation of joy.<br>
**Ahst**: Dragon, if I may.<br>
***Ahst** holds up her songblade<br>
**Ahst**: I'm a guardian of Inu, what do you mean there must always be a Traitor, what of the blade?<br>
**Hizigori**: Guardians. Very well. I shall tell you the story, but only for as long as the Eye can hold its strength.<br>

> **Arcadum**: To be clear, you're going to make saves as I make these stories, Toot. And whenever you fail enough Hiz will stop, he will not risk your life. There is no detriment to these saves.<br>
Since you have asked to know why there must always be a Traitor, then to explain that.

> **Hizigori**: For you to understand why there must always be a Traitor, then you must understand what the betrayal is, and for you to understand that you must learn the truth of the nature of this world. Indeed, you must learn of the Prism.
>
> In that which began all things know, at first there was Death, and he was alone. Lamenting in the sorrow of the infinite and the empty. So from there did spring Life, and from Life, Death grew conscious of what it was. And as Life grew, Death realized how fragile it was, and never could Death hold its friend, walk beside its child. But Death knew to keep it safe that promises must be made, and so formed the Seven Covenants. The Seven Promises, the Seven Corners, the Seven Points, the Seven Colors, the Prism that shielded the world, all worlds, from what lies beyond. And from there, there was peace, prosperity. But such is a curious thing, that the winds of change begin with the smallest breeze.
>
> The Prism is comprised of seven colors.

(First Wisdom saving throw, `19(13)`)

> **Hizigori**: Each one represents a covenant. Each one represents a truth, a promise, and all of them represent the eternity promised to Life by Lord Death. However, such things are difficult and Death is not omnipotent. Nothing is. And so, eventually an anomaly occurred, something that no being expected, or foresaw, and that was the Enemy.
>
> For within the Prism there are Seven duties, Seven purposes, seven Covenants. They are the promises of Lord Death, and they are the laws of this very world. The Covenants are Life, Time, Wisdom, Ambition, Dream, Death, and the shattered one, the broken covenant. It is in the broken covenant where the traitor emerged. And within the Prism, these covenants had their own guardians, you could say.<br>
For Life, it was Green that took upon it a shape of three points.<br>
For Time, it was Yellow, or Amber, as it's called, and from that four points took their shape.<br>
Wisdom took six points upon it and claimed the color Red.<br>
Ambition took upon it five points and Orange was its heraldry.<br>
The Dream, its covenant was that that is reflected on each side, the Blue Cross.<br>
And Death, its stillness by that of the Indigo.<br>
And the shattered covenant, that was the domain of the Violet, the most powerful of them all, betrayed the Prism. The reason, my dear, that the Traitor's blade is a songblade is because the Traitor was once one of you.<br>
For there were four guardians of the lifestream, and servants to Inu, secondaries to the Amber Sky, wielder, gatekeeper of the Quadrinox. 
But it was not the covenant of Time that allowed the betrayal, but rather the covenant of- 

(Second save, `20+1+5=26`)

> **Hizigori**: And that covenant was *Mercy*. For the Traitor's sorrow allowance was made. By the Traitor's sorrow a rule was broken. And for the Traitor's sorrow Mercy was given. And the Prism cracked, and *the time for Mercy has passed*. And that, Guardian, is why the Traitor's Blade is one of your own.

> **Moe**: You spoke of the red covenant and of Wisdom, as a Shaper I know that we serve the Astral Traveler, and she told me The Enemy feared her grave more than anything. Is she the cause of this rift? Did they know each other?<br>
**Arcadum**: The Dragon's gaze will fall to Toot, slowly it will lean toward him, until it is inches towards his face, the great dragon fills his vision, everything he can see.<br>
**Hizigori**: Brace yourself.<br>
**Arcadum**: The dragon will see that you are ready.

(The party all hold hands and place hands upon Toot to support The Bearer of The Eye)

> **Arcadum**: As each of you place your hands upon Toot, and upon each other, and stand against the weight of knowledge as one, the dragon will begin to answer. (To be clear what was your question, Criken?)<br>
**Moe**: What is the nature of the relationship between the Astral Traveler and the Enemy? And more specifically, is her death the cause of this rift?<br>
**Hizigori**: Their story begins in a place at the-

(Third saving throw: `24+4+2=30`)

> **Arcadum**: The dragon's words begin to weigh down on Toot and all those present, you will all be blown backwards, nearly off of your feet, but you will find your balance and hold firm. The Labyrinth will begin to shake, and shudder. Toots eye begins to glow brighter, and brighter, and brighter, until it shifts from Violet to Red.
>
> Toot, your eye has Prism shifted. Now you no longer see through the Enemy's eyes, and the Enemy no longer sees through your eyes. But the Traveler now sees through your eyes, and you see through the Traveler's eyes.<br>
You feel as if anymore pressure, Any. More. pressure would shatter you.<br>
The words of the dragon fall away, as the information you receive is from the memory of the Traveler herself, for now you see as she does.<br>

> **Toot**: Guys this is really taking a toll on me.<br>
**Moe**: Just a little longer, you got this buddy.<br>
**Mirage**: We're all here for you buddy.<br>
***Toot** will turn to Ahst, and just smiles.

> **Arcadum**: Toot this is what you see:<br>
You see the glowing Red Star, you see the expanse of the Astral Sea, and on a small, simple, stool, just in the middle of the Astral Sea on a small rock, you see yourself sitting. Sadly counting the days as they pass. Suddenly you look in at yourself, you sense that you are seeing yourself, and you feel a smile cross your face. Your hand will go up before your face, so that you can see it, and you will give yourself a reassuring gesture, specifically the Okay symbol, and then you will see yourself point, and with that your vision zooms forward as you walk through the astral sea at mind numbing blazing speeds, speeds that are impossible for any except you. You are the Astral Traveler, and you stand before the Twilight Station.
>
> However, as you walk through the Twilight Station you begin to see pieces, bits and pieces of it reform, like a reverie in your mind. As you reminisce about what it once was, you see the old dilapidated buildings left over upon the isle shift back to what they were. A pleasant village, a simple place. You smiled as you stood in the garden, you watched the sun rise over the horizon. The wind kissed your face, and you were happy.<br>
The memories fade, however, as you look at what you've become. What even is the measure of being human anymore, what even is the truth of it? These are words, questions in which you have no answer, no matter how much Wisdom you gather.<br>
You gaze up, then. Your Astral Sight revealing so much more to you than any other. Your vision zooms and twists upon the Astral Sea, until you see it. The Herald in all of its terrible life, you think of the heroes of Kalkatesh, you think of their actions. Their recent victory has gathered them much Order, you can feel its power surging through you. Perhaps it will be enough this time, perhaps it wouldn't. You pull up your sleeve, revealing a tattoo upon your wrist, you see the Seven-pointed Star, and you see that only two notches remain.
>
> You lift yourself up from the Twilight Station, and you travel to the other points, where secrets are hidden.<br>
And since you have made that save, you get the next one.
>
> You travel to a world that is wracked with ruin, buildings float in errant gravitational pulls, ones you easily circumvent and dance upon the edge of. Here you see the hubris of knowledge, and the thirst for power. The homeworld of Taladon, and the inception of the craft of the Taladoni mages.
>
> You stand within Maltos.
>
> You walk through its shattered streets, empty and lifeless. You walk within its cracked earth, to the core, the great facility meant to use the eternal power of Maltos to fuel its many machinations. Now it is cold and lifeless.<br>
And there within its center you float. You look with your eyes, soaking in every detail, as Toot memorizes the arcane sigils upon the walls. Slowly you check the walls again to make sure that which watches through your eyes can read it. You lift yourself up from Maltos, for there are but other secrets.

> **Arcadum**: Toot, I need another save.

(Fourth Saving throw: `16+1+7=24` (insufficient))

> **Arcadum**: The red light grows, and grows, and grows, and the benevolence on the other end realizes that you have reached your limit, and she will close her eyes. The red shifts back to Violet, and the dragon places a whisker upon Toot's head and puts him to sleep.<br>
**Hizigori**: It seems that you have reached the limit, do not despair, for your friend will recover, and there are six other eyes. Keep to your purpose, the labyrinth must be defeated.<br>

> **Moe**: What about all these, this new information, should we not act on it? Should we just keep chugging along in here?<br>
**Hizigori**: Become distracted with too much purpose and you shall achieve none of it.<br>
**Hizigori**: I must go, too long I have been sealed out of fear of corruption, and now I must take my place at the Northern Manifest.<br>
**Moe**: You will reside in the Astral Sea?<br>
**Hizigori**: Yes, but do not fear, for my kind has its own strengths, and you could always summon me when the night is filled with stars. Speak plainly and I should appear before you, but perhaps not as this. Perhaps something a little different.<br>
***Hiz** appears as a human.

> **Hizigori**: and remember, Hope is not so easily extinguished.
