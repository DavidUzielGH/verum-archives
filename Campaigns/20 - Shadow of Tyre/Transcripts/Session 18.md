# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 18

Aired: 11/07/2020

The party, Mirage included, continue to explore the remainder of the first floor of their wing of Tyre's Labyrinth.

## Relevant Lore

Continuing further westward the party arrives at a room with two fountains and a strange pool in the middle:
> **Arcadum**: [This pool](https://i.imgur.com/l34kDQ0.jpg) looks more like it's akin to the seers pool.

Eustace Truesights. He sees the silhouette of a shadowy figure floating above the pool.

Ahst doesn't sense any portals.

(Moe rolls Arcana - 17)

> **Arcadum**: This seems to be exactly like the seers pool you saw in the Vegan city, with one difference. It is made out of brass, and the water isn't crystal blue, but fetid green.

(Nature check on water - 18 from Raost)

> **Arcadum**: This water is not druidic, this water is Fae in origin. It is water from the first world.

Figure will shift and turn its gaze, it is a shadow.

> **Eustace**: Who are you?<br>
**Shadow**: Something Old. Older than most know.<br>
**Eustace**: What is your relation to this place, why are you here?<br>
**Shadow**: I am a pilfered memory, stolen from one of the sleeping legends.<br>
**Eustace**: Do you have a name?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: Weaponmaster.<br>
**Eustace**: What is this room, what is all this? Can you tell us?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: Tis water taken from a tears drop.<br>
**Eustace**: Do you have a relation to the seer?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: No.<br>
**Eustace**: Are you trapped?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: Yes. I cannot return.<br>
**Eustace**: Can we help?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: For you to free me you must find my body. My body is bound by a terrible spell, an awful spell.<br>
**Eustace**: Where is it?<br>
**Weaponmaster**: It is nearby. Follow the path to the south, there a body lies. A terrible spell traps it. I can see, I can-
>
> **Arcadum**: Since you have true sight, for the briefest moment, Eustace, you see something that no one has ever seen before. There is a flash of shadows, and you see them. Companions standing side by side, and this one to lead them. But you also see around them a great wheel, and on each wheel there is a marking of an iteration, and you are the sixth. This one stands at the first. As you look more closely you realize this one stands outside of the wheel.<br>
A shadow, much like the Seven appear on manifest.
>
> **Weaponmaster**: Before you go, stranger, be marked. For my body is bound, and a spell that will not allow you to release it without great peril. But should you do so, please, see to it that I am brought home.
>
> **Arcadum**: A crystal will appear on the edge of the basin. This crystal bears the symbol of a green, living, oak leaf, and it irradiates with the power of nature.

---

The party decides to continue westward before going where this Weaponmaster suggested. The next room over they find 4 snake statues. Checks reveal that they are indeed traps, motion sensitive, and fire disintegration beams.

Eventually, Toot devises a way to send a "clone" of himself in the hallway and finds the "off switch".

> **Arcadum**: Hidden in the back of each statue is a white pearl. The pearls are magically enchanted, they are pearls of disintegration. One time consumable uses of Disintegrate.

Moving past this hallway the party finds themselves in a room with many snake themed objects.

They also find what appear to be vault doors. They bear the symbol of a living oak leaf. The big snake is a doorway, and the entrance to the second floor.

### Heading South -- Rooms Out of Time

Having found the the path to the second floor the party heads back and goes southward to see what they can do to help this Weaponmaster shadow.

Making their way back up the hallway the green crystal they got from the shadow reveals a number of hidden doors that lead to a hidden set of rooms:
> **Arcadum**: When you walk in this room you see that there are old crates, sacks and shelves. They appear to be almost frozen in time, in a way. they are old enough they should be dilapidated and broken, but they aren't, but you can feel how old they are. The wood is thin and creaking with age, the sacks themselves are made of old wool, with larger holes in it, and since you see grains and food stuff. And you see a mysterious symbol stamped into the crates. It looks as if there are three teardrops, one large one, and two smaller ones.<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6I9IglE.jpg" alt="Drops of Tyr art" height="75px" />](https://i.imgur.com/6I9IglE.jpg)<br>
Inside the crate are oranges, but you do not think they would be edible. <br>***Eustace** grabs one and pulls it free intending to eat it.<br>
**Arcadum**: It turns to dust in his hands.


#### Adventurer's Supply Room

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xnZYI3P.jpg" alt="Adventurer's Supply Room Map" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/xnZYI3P.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: Once again more symbols on everything. However in the middle of the room you can see that there are three backpacks. The ones in the center are different. The top-right bears the mark of a hammer with a golden ring around it. Bottom is a symbol of running feet, and there seems to be a wild etched ring around it. Left one is a flaming fist etched into the satchel.

The party doesn't recognize any of these.

> ***Ahst** looks into the bottom satchel<br>
**Arcadum**: As you reach into the bag you can see what appears to be a rogue's contour of all sorts of supplies. Thieves tools, bags of gold, and an anklet that brims with magic.<br>
***Ahst** grabs the anklet and lifts it from the bag<br>
**Arcadum**: It slowly turns to dust.<br>

The party asks Eustace to hold up the green stone to see if it reveals anything in the room:
> **Arcadum**: As you hold up the stone you see images appear all around as it glows with a soft green light. You see shadows of adventurers and old companions.<br>
You see a serious looking elf, tall and strong with a slight smirk on his face, packing his bag.<br>
You see a shifty rogue moving a coin across his knuckles, smiling back at the tall Elf.<br>
You see a heavily armored human bound in iron, that looks like he's not having any of this.<br>
On the shelf is a quirky Halfling with a knife picking his teeth and wriggling his gigantic toes.<br>
You see a calm human maiden with a blue dress rolling her eyes.<br>
A dwarf inspecting his hammer as if it's not quite going to do the job.<br>
Finally, in the corner of the room, a middle-aged woman with a mithril hauberk over her chest, and a tabard bearing the mark of the tears. And the image fades.<br>
***Ahst** will commit their appearances to memory.

---

Moving to the eastern room and holding up the stone again:
> **Arcadum**: A spectral figure will appear. The figure is kneeled down on the ground in a stance of meditation, on his left side is a longsword, and on his right is another longsword. They appear to be twinblades and they bear the symbol of the living green oak on their hilts. The blades edges are marked with scars of their many battles.<br>
***Eustace** will meditate with the figure. Close his eyes, and free his mind to see if he can connect with the shadow at all.<br>
**Arcadum** As you meditate, Eustace feels the kiss of the soft winds, the smells of the forest, feels the presence of nature, a soft weight placed over your heart. A responsibility. You feel the motivation of the person next to you. The quiet determination. The responsibility. The cost of being strong is to care for the weak and each leaf calls to you. And then the vision fades.

---

Moving now southward into a wine cellar:<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K04DvTJ.png" alt="Wine Cellar Map" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/K04DvTJ.png)
> **Arcadum**: Voices of laughter, corks popping. You can see another figure appear. A Dwarf sits in the middle of the room, just hammering it back, laughing and hiccupping.<br>
***Raost** grabs a bottle
**Arcadum**: The wine turns to dust.
***Raost** mimics the gesture and sits with the dwarf
**Arcadum**: He feels a warm sense, and nothing else.

The spine of the books on the right-side of the room contain the stamp of the three tears.

---

Northward of the room that had the meditating dwarf they find themselves in a painting studio:<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZietsFt.jpg" alt="Painting Studio Map" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/ZietsFt.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: This shadow is the blue-robed maiden, just happily painting away. They are painting a group shot of seven companions standing in front of a river with a small town behind them. Above it is a title and it simply says "Phlan."

The party recognizes all of the figures on the painting.

Elven Ranger, 
Human fighter, 
Halfling Rogue, 
Half-elf Rogue, 
Human with robes, 
Dwarf, 
Middle-aged woman with the mithril hauberk.

---

Heading eastward from the "meditation" room the party finds themselves somewhere familiar. A lounge, but now somehow different with the presence of the green stone.
> **Arcadum**: You hear soft talking. You will see all seven companions seated in a room, talking with each other about what is to come. On the center of the table you will see that there are plans, and all seven companions are pointing at and discussing them. You see written in common "The Twilight Station".<br>
The Twilight Station is a fortress. A fortress against evil to stand as a bastion against those that would turn against the spellfire. And that they that know the truth of tears drop, know this my friends, that when the darkest night has come and the sun has faded from the horizons touch, that the Twilight Station stands forever.

---

The party now returns to the only room they have not searched. Ahst checks it for locks and traps while Moe uses his Power Word to look through the door:
> **Arcadum**: The door is not trapped, nor is it no longer locked. As you gaze through it on the other side you will see swirling thorned, brambled, vines of great and plenty. There, in a sarcophagus of whtie vines, is bound a man.<br>
There is no other presence in the room.
>
> You are able to discern that he is from the images you've been seeing, it is the Elven ranger.
>
> As you open the door, you walk onto hallowed ground. With each step it's like walking through a legend, or a fable. The presence before you has long since been undisturbed for countless turnings of the wheel. There the body of an Elven ranger lies resting in peaceful sleep, and yet, a yearning from the fog. A yearning to finish that which was started.<br>
***Eustace** steps forward with the crystal.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you raise up the crystal it will turn to dust in your hands, and move towards the body.
>
> Around you the voices begin to speak, softly at first, they rise as one, whispering from the edge of time. The edge of the wheel and then slowly the vines begin to give way. Slowly, the rest has ended. The petals bloom, and the sylvan prison gives way.<br>
As such, someone else will rise up. Spirit combined once more with the body, no longer does the First Ranger sleep. No longer is the first of The Seven bound within time. As all things have their beginnings, so too does this story, and the man that walks forward greets you with a simple smile.

(Unfortunately, his original player lost internet tonight, and was not able to join us. Arcadum will do his best.)

> **Arcadum**: I now introduce you to the first ranger, the first character of my best friend, Andy Smith. Son of my sensei and the soul of Falcon Bladeweaver.

> **Falcon**: Huh, well this is all very somber. Well if you're here that only means a couple of things are happening. Either A, this spell failed and you're here to rob me. Or the other option is that the spell worked.<br>
**Ahst**: You can say thank you<br>
**Falcon**: Thank you? For what?<br>
**Eustace**: We freed you from this place, and we're here to rescue you.<br>
**Falcon**: Rescue, huh? Yeah... yeah, alright.<br>
**Eustace**: More like free.<br>
**Falcon**: I am thankful to be awakened, don't get me wrong. It's just that uh, think... you might be misplacing a little bit of what you've just done. You haven't just released me, you've released what I represent.<br>
**Party**: What's that?<br>
**Falcon**: It seems like the translators we left behind have done their job. If you don't know that is a good job, because if you don't know, then that means that he doesn't know.<br>
**Party**: You mean him?<br>
***Party** will point to the sky<br>
**Falcon**: Yes, probably. Anyway, we have things to discuss. Am I the first to awaken?<br>
**Party**: As far as we know.<br>
**Falcon**: Nice. So be it.<br>
**Ahst**: Your stuff all keeps turning to dust by the way.<br>
**Falcon**: That's because it's not here, it's just a memory. But there is one thing that is here, and that's me.<br>
I sense that my lord has long since faded from this world, as I suspected already.<br>
Sleeping in a genesis tube will do that to you<br>
**Party**: A GENESIS WHAT?<br>
**Falcon**: Yeah. More on that later.<br>
**Moe**: Do you happen to know if this genesis tube comes with a genesis seed?<br>
**Falcon**: Yeah that's how you grow one?<br>
**Moe**: Do you have a spare for me?<br>
**Falcon**: No.<br>
**Falcon**: Listen up, and listen well. If you're here, hm, actually.<br>
***Falcon** points to Mirage<br>
**Falcon**: You. Come here.<br>
***Falcon** will look at Mirage.<br>
**Falcon**: Yep, you're infused with Inu, alright.<br>
Sorry, I needed a Chord. Well, that settles it then.<br>
Well then, according to the energy emanating from this one you're on the sixth. I suppose there's worse things, we could be on the seventh.<br>
**Party**: Can you elaborate?<br>
**Falcon**: Don't worry, I'm about to unconfuse you. First off, well, hm. Where to start? As I said, I am the First Ranger, I am one of the- do you know of the Seven at least?<br>
**Party**: Yes.<br>
**Falcon**: Well, I am one of the first Seven. As one of the first Seven it was on that day when everything changed. It was driven to madness when the first refraction occurred. At the time we had no idea of what it meant. The fates that would be, it would seem, took mercy upon us. And that was their fatal flaw. My knowledge of this is not omniscient, but I was there.<br>
I was there when the worst happened. I was there when we were all betrayed. And so the time has come, time has come to fix our mistake. Set all things right. Good. I thank you for this opportunity, for now that my purpose has been restored, I know what it must be.<br>
***Falcon** will hold up his hand, and it'll slowly start to turn to dust, and he’ll pull it back together.<br>
**Falcon**: The cost for my immortality, it would seem, is my relevance to Memory. There are very few places that can sustain myself and my companions, and limited still on the strength that we yet possess.<br>
However that does not mean that such things can not be shared, or more importantly, earned. So, you've come this far, are you ready to show me what you can do?<br>
**Party**: Absolutely!<br>
**Falcon**: Good. But first, the left and right hand of Silvanus has returned to the world and though my lord may [not] exist in this realm, I do. And so it was and so it shall be, the first of Seven returns. And the Traitor shall know my name again.<br>
***Falcon** will turn his gaze upwards, he will begin to say a name, but then stop.<br>
**Ahst**: What is your name?<br>
**Falcon**: My name is Falcon Bladeweaver.<br>
**Arcadum**: And then he will say his name again, but this time as a Power Word.<br>
**Falcon**: Falcon Bladeweaver.<br>
**Arcadum**: There is an undulation of might that pulses out from the man. There you see he is fully regaled in the armament he once held in his life. On his left and right are twin longswords. The Fangs and Claws of Silvanus. His armor, wooden platemail, etched with the holy symbols of the Oaken Father, and upon his back a great cloak, within it wrapped dozens of weapons that seem to shimmer and shift into the folds.<br>
**Falcon**: Now then, let us see what these new heroes are made of.<br>


> **Arcadum**: As you have freed the first of the First Seven you have released a Legend into the world again. As you have done so this legend adds their strength to the heroes of Kalkatesh. The heroes of Kalkatesh gain 10 Order.
>
> Falcon Bladeweaver is a Trial of Legend, where you may fight one of the six original seven. You may form a party of seven from any group, and fight one of the 6 original Seven.

> **Party**: Our camp was attacked by one of his servants, and we have it on good authority they’ll attack again on the 21st.<br>
**Falcon**: They're called servants? Hmph.<br>
***Falcon** will laugh skeptically at that.<br>
**Falcon**: To be completely honest, I want to start testing these new heroes.<br>

Falcon will reveal he has the ability to traverse anywhere a tree exists which prompts Eustace to ask about Seren's party:
> **Eustace**: Seren has a tree, can you walk through hers?<br>
***Falcon** LITERALLY WALKS THROUGH A TREE, TO THE EDGE, INTO THE SCAR<br>
**Arcadum**: (Well, this is gonna be awkward...)<br>
**Falcon**: They're currently taking Koga's trial.<br>
**Ahst**: Who the fuck is Koga?<br>
**Falcon**: Koga is one of my companions.<br>

(Koga is the rogue.)

The party continues conversing with Falcon and decides to show him the sketch Raost made of the painting in the other room:
> ***Falcon** will start pointing out things to change with the painting:<br>
**Falcon**: This needs to be different.<br>
***Falcon** then points out each of their lapels.<br>
**Arcadum**: Koga's lapel that binds his cloak shows a scar of Indigo.<br>
The blue-robed woman, her lapel is that of a Blue Cross.<br>
Falcon's is a Green Triangle.<br>
The middle-aged woman with the mithril haubek is a Yellow Square.<br>
The heavily armored man is an Orange Star.<br>
The Dwarf, drinking deep of life, is the Red Star.<br>
And the Halfling, seated upon the shelf, bears the Seven-pointed Violet Star.<br>
**Raost**: You can't tell us who that is right now can you?<br>
**Arcadum**: The man is silent.<br>
**Raost**: Can you tell us about Phlan?<br>
**Arcadum as Falcon**: I cannot. For it is copyrighted!

> **Falcon**: It is a place in another time. In another world. Suffice to say that this world is older than most know and older still beyond that. Perhaps if you prove yourselves strong enough I shall reveal more. Perhaps.<br>
**Moe**: Would you want us to find the rest of your companions?<br>
**Falcon**: Oh yes, that is required, but I dare say you don't need to worry about that my friend.<br>
***Falcon** looks up towards the sky, seeing something that no one else can.<br>
**Falcon**: That they're already on their way.

Introductions are exchanged.

> **Falcon**: Well met. It's so strange, although you bear different visages, you're different people, you all seem to walk the same path. There is an irony there. No matter how many times it changes, it stays the same.

---

Falcon eventually departs through the tree back up to the surface to see if he can make it back to Phlan.

The rest of the party begins to leave, however, Toot stops by the tree and drops off a Goodberry and mutters a small prayer. Raost, inspects for flowers and picks a few:
> **Arcadum**: There are several white roses that grow along the vines. As you grab it, make me a nature check.

(`18` from Raost)

> **Arcadum**: This flower, that grows over what would have been basically Falcon's tomb, rest, sarcophagus, whatever you might call it. Is a flower that you've only heard about whispered in old texts. It is believed to be a mythological flower that doesn't exist. It is a flower called Clementia.

Raost will take two of them. Ahst will take one and give another to Mirage.

> **Arcadum**: As you give the flower to Mirage it will radiate with energy. Mirage, you gain the blessing of Clementia. Because you are lower level than you are supposed to be the flower of Mercy will shine its white light upon you and as such the next time that you would be killed you are instead reduced to 1hp and teleported to Camp Last Stand.

("Killed" in this context is dead-dead, failing all death saving throws.)

---

The party returns to the room with the pool adjacent to the tapestry room they found previously (the one containing the tapestry that teleported Raost to Omen) where they had left a silver chest and finally open it:
> **Arcadum**: Silver chest contains three silver flasks. These are Elixirs of Eternity. These potions, if consumed, restore the creature to full health. That means full HP, no exhaustion, removal of all detrimental conditions, and restores to life.

(Falcon Bladeweaver is a Power Word in the Supernal language.)
