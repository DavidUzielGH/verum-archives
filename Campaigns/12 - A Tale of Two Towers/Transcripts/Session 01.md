## Relevant Lore

A young man, about 22 years old, of Majitalian descent is lying on his back a cold sweat breaking out across his face. He seems very pale, even with someone of his darker complexion. You also see that he is tremoring slightly, which is indicative of being possessed.

> **Arcadum**: Tyrsis, you recognize the man from your vision, he is the same person. Make me a medicine check.

Party rolls medicine/history to little avail but does their best to help him.

> **Arcadum**: Tyrsis as you inspect him yet another vision returns to your mind. You see the same field of golden wheat, you can see the seer walking through the field. and you see that the seers walking through the field lead you to what appears to be an enormous hole in the ground, and there you can see sarcophagai and burial chambers, and there in the center you can see what appears to be a playing card atop a sarcophagus. And it is burning with a bright fiery light, which the seer is holding his head and turning away from. And then, you return.

Tyrsis asks about the card, rolls 3 on history, doesn't recognize it.


> **Robund Rone**: Valeer has been in our employ for a few years. Met him in Majital, came on the expedition and all seemed well. A few days ago he came down with a sickness.
