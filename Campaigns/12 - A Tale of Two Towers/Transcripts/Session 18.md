After the Translator, Taffy Taps, surfaces one of The Seven from Ulm’s soul:

> **Arcadum**: As Nadia raises her staff, the presence of The Seven becomes tangible once more. The room begins to shake. It swirls with power all around her. Ulm’s eye begins to refract and then behind Nadia several other shadows appear. Shadows of the heroes of the past. They reflect further out, their voices raised as one. Nadia calls forth the power within her staff, the shred of strength that yet remains.
>
> The voices raise louder. The air around you begins to shift and swirl as reality bends. Nadia lowers her staff and there, conjured in front of you, is a spectral tome that opens with a crescendo. As it does so, the pages flip, swirling through history, through time, through alternate futures and forgotten pasts, until finally, one of the pages stops. And there symbols begin to appear, written by an unseen hand, scribbling across writing your very names into the pages. She raises her staff once more. The ink, the very images, the letters, your names fly from the page and swirl upwards into the air and shatter. Like a soft rain, your destinies once intertwined elsewhere, are ready to be rewoven and your choice is held before you. You may choose to continue the paths you have been walking or you may choose to walk the path of the Seven.
>
> Should you choose The Seven, step here.<br>
***Arcadum** points to the area in front of the party.<br>
**Arcadum**: Should you choose the alternate path, step here.<br>
***Arcadum** points behind the party.<br>
**Arcadum**: The choice is yours.

(The party debates the choice, but in the end, all step forward to walk the path of the Seven)

> **Arcadum** As Elwood stumbles forward, he sees that he is not alone, as standing beside him is his old friend.

(Bernard is revealed, a token placed beside Elwood)

> **Arcadum**: As each of you step forward Nadia will smile and her staff will raise above her head. Your destinies are then rewoven into the tapestry as the torch has been passed and all around you, slowly, you can feel something in the air change. Your hair stands up on the back of your head. Your bodies tingle and slowly, you watch one of the Seven reweave your destiny. And then you hear them, soft at first, barely audible--more of a feeling then a voice--but then you hear the chant slowly beginning to rise from just beyond sight, just beyond sound. The voices call. They raise up.
>
> Nadia’s staff begins to glow once more and then she reveals to you: Your path--to walk the path of the Seven--will be to journey, not towards Tyre as the others have, but you must gather the remaining stones. For without the stones, those that walk the path of Tyre cannot succeed. The Shattered Gate cannot be repaired without the stones. And so, Nadia weaves your fate.
>
> You see the path before you. You have one, but you must gather the remaining eight. Only with the nine stones can the Shattered Gate be repaired, and with it, the Twilight Station found. Nadia raises her staff.
>
> The world shakes again. Magic curtails from the staff exploding outwards all around her and then finally, descending into each of you. Choosing your path has instilled you with additional strength. You feel that your powers grow with each passing moment.<br>
Tirsis, you are granted the gift of the disciples of dragons’ past. Your body shifts and changes.<br>
Gorrul, the fathers and daughters of stone pound their anvils and reforge your skin.<br>
Elwood, you feel the power of the gnomes of the past flow through you.<br>
Claw, the Tabaxis, a people of nomadic heritage dance against their beaten drums and throw their pawed hands up toward you.<br>
And Dusty, your service has been rewarded; youth returns to your skin and you are granted the time you need.
>
> And so it is done. Where there was once Nadia, there now stands Ulm.
