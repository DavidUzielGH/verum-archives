## Relevant Lore

Seer has calmed down.

> **Arcadum**: As you stand over him the amulet will begin to thrum in your hand. it is definitely reacting to being near the seer.

Seer is still unconscious.

> **Arcadum**: As amulet is moved near him it thrums faster and faster. Just as you are about to touch, see his eyes open.

> **Valeer**: who are you?<br>
**Robund**: valeer, you've awoken.<br>
**Valeer**: commander what happened? I was lost in a city of ghosts and phantoms, it was , I could not see the sun. The sky was night, and gray. I heard a voice, it spoke, but I could not hear it. it was heard, but i could not hear.<br>
**Valeer**: i did see one thing, I saw a farm to the north. I could see it from a body outside of my own body.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Did it have a wheat field<br>
**Valeer**: Yes it had a wheat field, to the north. There was a great maw in the land, and I fell through it.<br>
Robund: Valeers powers allow him to see glances into the future, he has clairvoyance of certain things, but he has never been afraid. I have never seen him like this. When we first arrived all seemed well, then on the first night he convulsed and then fell to the ground. I have down what I can but I am no sage. Had you not come along I fear he would have perished by now.<br>
**Dusty**: He just started convulsing and writhing from nothing?<br>
**Robund**: Well I believe he tried to use his powers.<br>
**Tyrsis**: In what capacity?<br>
**Robund**: Normally he does a nightly ritual where he looks ahead a few powers, calls it his night watch. Looks ahead to see if we're being spotted. This night was much like any other night traveling, except the screams he made, I could not fathom it. I thought he was possessed.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Was this the first night after the stones with draconic runes had been brought in?

Valeer is looking a bit better, semi-conscious.

>**Valeer**: I certainly feel better<br>
**Dusty**: Thatâ€™s good, any changes, any revelations, visions?<br>
**Valeer**: My visions have left me, it seems. For now.<br>
**Tyrsis**: what was the significance of why they left you on the night they did? is there any reason they would have acted up, did you do anything differently that day?<br>
**Valeer**: Not that I can remember, I did my visions as I always do. I sit down, and I recite the mantras, then they come to me. I have been doing this for some time, much of the time i have been with Robund. Although, I suppose...

> **Arcadum**: He thinks on it, kind of realizing something for the first time.

> **Valeer**: There was perhaps one thing different. The runes that I had read. I noticed that there was a difference among them. It is difficult for me to describe, but essentially, I had read them and provided a translation. But when I saw them at night they had something different.<br>
**Tyrsis**: what did they say at night?<br>
**Valeer**: I could not translate it. I did try, but I was unable to. I did feel strange, afterwards.<br>
**Tyrsis**: Did you speak out loud? perhaps it was an incantation you accidentally said.<br>
**Valeer**: I suppose that could be true, but you would know better than I. It was draconic, and that is not my field of study.<br>
**Dusty**: Do you remember anything about the runes at all, could you draw something?<br>
**Valeer**: Yes, I could draw them for you.

These draconic runes are the reverse of the other words. Runes that would translate to say "`Golden fields, golden gates`" will instead say "`Suffer thee the wrath of eight`".
