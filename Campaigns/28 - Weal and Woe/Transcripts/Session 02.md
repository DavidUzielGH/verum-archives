Aired: 11/10/2020

## Relevant Lore

Picking up where the previous session left off, the screams they heard get closer and are more Negatia Beasts approaching from the west.

As the fight goes on, a few rounds later perception checks are made and the party sees Psychosis Demons approaching them from within the room containing the buried statue.

Mara performs an Arcana check on a Psychosis Demon reveals that it is not real, and disappears from her sight alone. She calls out to the rest of the party to inform them as much.

Throughout the fight when the Psychosis Demons' inititive everyone appears to blink out of existence for a moment and are brought back. However, the Demons are now closer. A second time and they are both closer and the party's positions are swapped.

Eventually as the fight winds on the Errant Memories swap the Psychosis Demon into the Negatia Beasts, then line up and hit them all with a wave of psychic energy killing them. The fight ends.

---

The party then moves to further inspect the buried statue.

> **Arcadum**: The visage appears to be that of a man speaking, and the jaw is broken on to the ground. It seems that the entirety of the statue must be massive. It is buried beneath the earth and the scaffolding and those with excavation tools have been meticulous in their excavation.<br>
However, whilst you are standing there you feel an uneasiness, as if every sense that you have is activated all at once. You feel as if you hear something, or see something, but there is nothing there. A firing of synapses across the body.<br>
<br>
As you look around at the Errant Memories the first thing you notice is that they are dolls. They are made out of porcelain and very esoteric designs with arcane sigils that you don't recognize. However, in the inside of the mask of the head of the doll there is a symbol that is transcribed and it is the symbol of the Taladoni.

(`20` History on the Taladoni)

> **Arcadum**: The Taladoni were an ancient order and race of mages that existed in Kalkatesh before the major races came to power. It is even said they existed before the Elven empire in the second era, they exist now in the Rift, a place of wild magic, and swirling churning energies. The Taladoni are rumored to have disappeared sometime during the first or second era, however there are still bits and pieces left behind by their travels and studies, by their great archivist libraries, and other unknown machinations they were about. It seems this doll is such a thing.

Mara tries to commune with the statue via telepathic cupcake transmission.

> **Arcadum**: Mara conjures a vision of a door of black iron etched with runes you do not recognize. Above it stands a proud antlered being of some kind. A visage and figurine, hands outstretched in a figure of worship, all around the door are errant lines of magic.

---

The party investigates the area and finds a number of deep pits. They hear the cries of a child from one of the pits and Mara dives down and brings her up. The girl is malnourished and points at the statue. The girl's name is Anna.

Lily flies down another hole:
> **Arcadum**: As he flies down he sees a tunnel errant with shale and rock twists and contorts itself into visages of screaming faces. They are silent, however, as they are not but etchings in the stone. As you get to the bottom there are no children here, but there is one other thing you see. Sitting upon a small pedestal with all the faces pointing at it, there is a ruby that glows with a soft light. Red.<br>
As you place your hand upon the strange ruby it is cool to the touch and slightly heavier than you thought it'd be. Nothing seems to happen.<br>
As you start to fly up, you notice all of the faces shift to follow you, then you fly out and nothing seems to happen.

The party remembers they have torches and decide to see what is in the remaining holes before diving in:

> **Arcadum**: In the next hole. This hole has hands adorning the wall and as the torch hits the ground stone hands reach out and smash it.

> **Arcadum**: The final hole. The torch falls and falls and falls until it is put out as it lands in red water.

(Mara rolls a `24` on medicine on Anna)

> **Arcadum**: The signs of malnutrition appear as if she has been drained. Color of hair and size implies that this is the child you were looking for. There is a deep anger that grows ithin her faith, something or someone took this child, and experimented upon them. This is probably the closest you could get to ultimate blasphemous in the faith of Lorita.

Lily goes down the final hole with a torch:

> **Arcadum**: The red water is blood, and lots of it. On further investigation you notice there is something inside of it. Lily touches the blood with his toe.
(`10` dex saving throw)

> **Arcadum**: Solidified ropes of blood reach out wrapping around you, and pull you down inside.

Mara descends the hole to try and save Lily, keeping distance from the pool, she sees no sign of Lily. Group ties rope around Mara and Mara will throw bread down into the blood.

Mara dives in to save Lily. Rope gets taut, and everyone needs to make a strength saving throw.

(`15, 9, 3` All of them failed)

Meni and Barbie are pulled into the pit. Laius is pulled to the edge and cuts the rope.

---

Laius decides the best course of action, being the only one of the party left, to leave the mines with Anna and head back to town to get some help.

On the way out he grabs the "remains" of the one Errant Memory killed during the previous fight and drags it with him as he exits the cave.

Eventually, the Memory begins to move again and starts to lead Laius through the tunnels. At one point it stops and moves in close to Laius. He chooses to let it do what it will. It places its mask across his face and:

> **Arcadum**: ...grows wooden across the back of your face, at first you can't breathe and then you see it.

The mask leads him back to where he just came from, back to the room with the buried statue. On the way there the "existence blink" happens again.

> **Arcadum**: But because the mask is on Laius he sees where they go.

Laius planeshifts into the dream, walks a few steps, and then planeshifts back.

Back in the room with the statue, it will shift as Laius approaches.

> **Arcadum**: As you stand before the statue its visage twists and you see its true face. Not the position it was in, but instead with a hand offered for elevation.

Laius climbs the hand.

With the mask on and on the hand Laius planeshifts again.

### Ethereal Meadhall

> **Arcadum**: The mask transports you to this place. It appears to be a longhouse of some kind. There are great pillars with esoteric runes, and ethereal fire that warms the area. All around you there are butterflies with white energy floating by. Hanging from the ceiling, or floating upon the ceiling, there appear to be perfect diamond hemispherical crystals, radiating all the different colors of light. Prisms.<br>
<br>
The mask falls away, its purpose served. Anna yet remains unconscious, as you speak you will hear a voice.<br>
**Unknown Voice**: Come forth, do not be afraid. It is rude to linger in doorways hahahaha.<br>
**Laius**: Where am I?<br>
**Unknown Voice**: You are in a place hidden, and yet, seen by all.<br>
**Arcadum**: Seated here you see this:<br>
<br>
**Taladon, the Last of Maltos. The Omnitex.**<br>
[<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716723358682710118/775839679236538418/unknown.png" alt="Taladon's Handout" height="250px" />](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716723358682710118/775839679236538418/unknown.png)<br>
<br>
**Taladon**: I greet you, traveler.<br>
**Laius**: Why was I brought here?<br>
**Taladon**: A curious question. Why?<br>
There have been those that have sought the question *why* for most of their lives. And yet for each *why* closed another opened. But enough of philosophy. You are here because the msaks brought you to me.<br>
You are here because power, terrible power, has been unearthed in the world of the waking. And as such I must see to it that what little strength that remains from my time is not misused. It would appear that your companions have fallen into an unfortunate side effect of its misuse.<br>
**Laius**: They have.<br>
**Taladon**: Fear not, there is no need for your service, I have already collected them.<br>
**Laius**: Where are they?<br>
**Taladon**: Next to you.<br>

(The rest of the party appears next to Laius, unaware of anything that transpired from when they fell into the blood and now.)

> **Taladon**: It is not mercy, nor is it anything worthy of thanks. I am not worthy of either. And Mercy? I think you will find is an irony in this place.<br>
**Party**: What is the irony?<br>
**Taladon**: You stand in all that remains of the shattered covenant. The covenant known as Mercy, my greatest folly.<br>
**Mara**: What is the covenant of Mercy?<br>
**Taladon**: When life first sprung from the infinite night, Death was enamoured with it. For long had Death been alone, and now Life. But when Death tried to embrace it it fell away nearly to ruin, and Death was sorrowed. For this wonderful thing he could never be a part of, but knew he that it must grow.<br>
And so, as Life began to grant, and to what the Viaken call Yggdrasil, the Lifestream, the Great Tree, The Wheel. It has many names. Death made Seven promises, covenants, to bind his strength so that never again would his touch brandish unwarranted, and shift unsealed.<br>
**Party**: Seven covenants?<br>
**Taladon**: And for a millennia these promises held true, and life grew, and the branches that were faulty and rotten Death cut away, so that more life could grow. Until the Traitor came.<br>
**Party**: Who was the Traitor?<br>
**Taladon**: That is a name that few know,and none that know that will ever tell you. Do not seek its name, know only that it exists.<br>
**Lily**: What do you need for us to do?<br>
**Taladon**: I will never ask of you, for you are yet young, untested. But your audacity, your courage, is something truly marvelous. There is prudence among you. There is good judgement, and there is just enough of that mortal.. that mortal, uh, how should I put this, hubris. That you may succeed where so many others have failed.<br>
<br>
There are forces beyond your understanding that move just beyond your sight, and there are others like you, selected for the great testing at the crossroads that is yet to come. For our world is on its sixth iteration, and should we fail again, the seventh will be our doom.<br>
<br>
There is a lot to deal with, but for now know that you are amongst friends. Feast, rest, within my domain, for you have earned it. And curious still, you have brought me an Ananthem.<br>
**Party**: The ruby!<br>
**Taladon**: While an Archon still is a powerful boon that is not yet it. You hold the Ananthem in your hands warrior.<br>
***Taladon** points to Anna<br>
**Mara**: What will you do with this child?<br>
**Taladon**: Your faith in Lorita, it is a strong one, but what you need to understand is at the moment the ritual was performed upon her, she is not a child any longer. I am not satisfied with this methodology in which those that use my ancient gifts unwarranted, incorrect. Regardless of how it was made the Ananthem is here, and with it, Hope. Hope may yet still prove strong.<br>

> **Taladon**: Please, your skepticism is healthy. You have no reason to believe my words, so I will not ask you to trust me. I shall demonstrate. Place the child upon the table.

Anna is placed on the table.

> **Taladon**: Behold. Without any stimulation, she sleeps. But the Ananthem is a conduit of Mana, a powerful one, and that is the key. Sprite, present the archon stone towards her.

The ruby is placed on Anna.

> **Arcadum**: As you put the ruby down on top of Anna it will shatter, and then it will filter in through her nose, and mouth, and eyes. She will let out a brief cry.

And then, Ananthem will appear.<br>
[<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716723358682710118/775842370532016128/artstation_1779641_5687597_R_E_D_W_I_T_C_H.jpg" alt="Ananthem Handout" height="250px" />](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716723358682710118/775842370532016128/artstation_1779641_5687597_R_E_D_W_I_T_C_H.jpg)

Taladon will place his hand upon her head, and she will sleep once more.

> **Mara**: What has she been turned into? What is an Ananthem?<br>
**Taladon**: The Ananthem is a conduit of mana. The ritual used, however, is one that I do not agree with during the time of my council. However, although that school of magic is not one I enjoyed using, it is just as powerful as the others. And so the Ananthem has been made, but she is unstable. Too young she was exposed to the Prismatic and so she shall need guidance, she shall need a guiding hand. I ask nothing of you that you do not offer yourselves. Speak the words and you shall return to your lives in the waking realm, but I will not dissuade the importance of what you see before you, and the Weals and Woes of the world. Can you assist her?<br>
Will you assist me?<br>
**Mara**: We will do anything to prevent another child from suffering this fate. I have a tragic backstory myself, similar to this child, you know.<br>
**Arcadum**: Taladon will summon images of your entire past.<br>
**Taladon**: Your tragedy is a terrible woe, but it is not uncommon.<br>
**Arcadum**: All around him stories just like yours will begin to appear, they will expand outward as all the previous iterations.<br>
**Taladon**: Suffering is shared by us all.<br>
**Lily**: What do you need us to do for this to never occur again?<br>
**Taladon**: The first thing you must do is return to the mine and see to it that the ancient runes there are kept safe elsewhere. If you do agree to this I shall grant you a fraction of my strength.<br>
**Party**: We agree.<br>
**Taladon**: So be it. And one last time, the archons ride again.

> **Arcadum**: Taladon will offer up a measure of his strength, and it shall flow into each of you, and you are all now level 2.

> **Lily**: May we ask for more power?<br>
**Taladon**: Hahahaha, the audacity of the mortals. Would it be that I offer it to you, your body will crumble and be set alight into fire if I were to give you anymore. With time you will become acclimated to the strength that will come.<br>
Know this. My people are knowledgeable of the cost of power. What it means to seek it. I understand your excitement, but do not give in to your baser nature, lest you bring ruin upon us all as I did those years ago.<br>
**Meni**: Is there a way for us to get into contact with you once again?<br>
**Taladon**: Of course, archons, you will need these.<br>
**Arcadum**: He will offer you all circlets to wear upon your heads.<br>
These are not only magical items, but they represent your rank as an Archon, as a servant directly to one of the Taladonic lords, and it will allow you to speak with him.<br>
**Taladon**: Listen well, with your newfound strength you shall attract the attention of the Enemy. A being that stands against us all, and the purpose, I suspect, the Ananthem was recreated. I have done what I can to predict the Enemy's movements, now it seeks the Traitor's Blade. It cannot be allowed to happen, but we are not in a position to stop it. There are those that search the labyrinth, and those that search the stones, and those yet that serve one of the many orders.<br>
<br>
There is a place that I must send you, a place that has been overrun. A place that is broken. I must send you to my towers that yet still remain and there we must gather what we can and search them carefully. For if we are able to uncover the prismatic gate, I may yet see my home again, and there the weapons we need to face the Enemy.<br>
<br>
**Party**: What do these circlets do?<br>
**Taladon**: They will grant you clarity when battle pumps through your mind. They will also manifest themselves according to your own essence the more you use them, and the longer that they are attuned to you. They are made out of Archonici stone. They are very rare, do not lose them.<br>
Rest, for when you have finished I shall return you to the waking realm, for your presence has already gone noticed by the Enemy. You must return to where you whence came as if nothing happened. Say your report, then leave quickly. Once you are outside of the city, contact me again. I shall send a friend to carry you to the Rift.<br>
**Mara**: Is there anything else we need to know about the Enemy?<br>
**Taladon**: Beware thee the color of Violet. Never trust its like.<br>

> **Taladon**: Very well, I return you to the waking realm. I wish you the most pristine of luck, my Archons. And seek thee not to repeat the Folly of Maltos.

(Last time someone spoke to Taladon in a game was 8 years ago.)
