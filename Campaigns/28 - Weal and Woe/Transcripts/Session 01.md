# Weal and Woe -- Session 01

Aired: 11/03/2020

The party begins in the town of Greyrest in Steton, called to investigate an issue at the nearby quarry.

## Relevant Lore

### Grayrest

Greyrest has a monument in the center of town that contains the souls of warriors past.

### The Quarry

When they get to the mines they find tools for torture and materials to create sedative potions. In a nearby pool of water they find a corpse chained underwater.

The party pulls the corpse free and it is a toothless being maimed and lacerated. It appears to have died in the middle of a transformation and not to drowning or other bodily harm. As the party leaves it behind, it reanimates and is revealed to be a Negatia Beast.

> **Arcadum**: Its almost human face, a remnant of what it once was.

The party's first fight. They defeat the lone Negatia Beast and move on further into the mines.

> **Arcadum**: A powerful foreboding, and almost gut wrenching wave of nausea falls over the party. It appears to be magical in nature, and the party can't determine what the source is, but it appears to be coming from the next room.<br>
A mostly naked humanoid, with a ring of orange fire as a crown, and hair composed of gripping and gnashing hands. The being is an outsider.<br>

> **???**: It seems that I am not alone in this place.<br>
**Laius**: Can we pass?<br>
**???**: I am no warden of the bridge, but a warden of the Bridge.<br>
**Laius**: We wish not to fight, let us pass peacefully.<br>
**???**: This one seeks no bloodshed, this one seeks only truth. Only what was stolen.<br>
**Laius**: What lies beyond the bridge?<br>
**???**: Beyond this place memory is contorted. Mind, fluid, time, shattered.

A number of party members move past `???` to the other side of the bridge:
> **Arcadum**: The creature makes no attempt to stop you as you cross the bridge.<br>

Mara moves up to speak with him before crossing the bridge herself:
> **Mara**: Why are you tied here, why are you in this realm?<br>
**???**: This one was freed from below?<br>
**Mara**: Freed by the workers of this mine?<br>
**???**: This one believes it is them, I have not seen them in some time.<br>
**Mara**: Were you the one transforming the workers?<br>
**???**: This one knows not of the... This one understands transformation... You believe that which you see is not already is but rather the saw of your normalcy. But this one has not caused their revelation. This one has only sought its missing piece.

Lily moves up to Mara & ???:
> **Lily**: Oh great... Thing... Why are you here?<br>
**???**: Freed from below, I watched... I watched the key, but now I am lost without it.<br>
**Lily**: What key do you speak of?<br>
**???**: The key of Orange fire, of Ambition. Now into folly.<br>
**Mara**: What's your name?<br>
**Xalax**: This one's name is Xalax.<br>
**Mara**: Have you seen a child?<br>
**Xalax**: This one has not seen one, but it hears it now.

The rest of the party crosses the bridge and again moves deeper into the mines. Further and further until they eventually come upon a larger room where something is partially excavated:
> **Arcadum**: A great stone statue irradiating an ominous feeling and a dark magic. In here the shadows darken and you feel an unsettling presence. You feel that you are being watched, you are being hunted. And then you hear a blood curdling scream from behind.

Arcadum lets out a dope scream, then ends the session.
