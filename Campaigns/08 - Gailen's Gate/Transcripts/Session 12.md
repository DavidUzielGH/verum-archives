### Acorn's Warning

> **Acorn**: Tyre was one of 5 Bishops that served the unknowable Enemy. And as such was not defeated. His maleficence can still be sensed, even within the confines of the earth. Its stain corrupting not just the soil, but the time therein.
>
> Raquel, tries as she might to fix what was broken, but as long as these beings exist there can be no healing. The other four yet remain unchallenged and that is a purpose for another prophecy. For now, as it was handed down in stone and sand you must face the wizard Tyre. You must destroy him and any trace of his might. For a failure to do so may yet bring a second reckoning. And already the Astral stones whisper of its return. There are ebbings within the edges of minds. A wrongness rises just beyond the horizon. I fear the other continents may yet still suffer. There is still yet much to do.
