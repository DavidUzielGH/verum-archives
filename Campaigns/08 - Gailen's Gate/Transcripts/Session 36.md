### Conversation w/ A Translator

On the topic of power words.

Disguised’s transcript:
> **Bellanoven**: Can you explain the full potential and the full repercussions of these words?<br>
**Nosfret**: To understand that, one must first understand what power is. For the words you speak are no more powerful than other words, but their meanings are less diluted. Their meanings are true, their meanings are actual. The words you speak shudder with the primal power of those that came before.<br>
**Braktor**: The Nephilim?<br>
**Nosfret**: It is said that they possessed their own language, but it has been lost. Only Seven factotums remain. And of those too few precious few can read.<br>
**Braktor**: What’s a factotum?<br>
**Nosfret**: A factotum is a representation of one’s inherent knowledge. There are Seven such spectrums that still remain.<br>
**Braktor**: One of the nephilim from what I recall was named after one of these words. Are they old?<br>
**Nosfret**: Yes, the Nephilim were the first to feel, the first to desire, formed from the primal forces.<br>
**Braktor**: I uh, I remember another one but I don’t think that I knew him by one of these names. Is it safe to speak here? Because there’s uh, some bad shit happening in your uh-<br>
**Nosfret**: Your eye reveals your nature Seven. Your kind lingers on the edge of existence. Know this: that I will keep my promise that I made to your kind, even if it means that I must deny you. You were very clear in your instructions.
