### Empress Doe's Speech

> **Empress Doe**: The Seven are not gods, not like the others. They are hailed as gods. The Seven are, or were, but mortal kin, refracted through souls and time. The enemy that they faced was of such power that all of creation itself was challenged. The cost of their victory is also their defeat. It is said, at least, The Seven can’t help for they are not here. They are stuck between existence and oblivion. A subtle shadow on the wall. It is said that The Seven sometimes live anew, reflected through a new soul. I’m not sure if I believe it, for I have searched for my beloved many times, and I have never found him.
>
> Existence is not a singular example. The Great Tree of life has many branches and many roots. And it is guarded by Lord Death. For you to understand what is happening you must understand the truth of the world. Creation is garnered into two halves. Chaos of Life and the Order of Death. Death, in this case, is not a person but an entity with feelings and thoughts. He is the one above all. He is the guardian of Life. And it is by his solemn watch that we are allowed to live. Death wields his power to garden the branches that would fail so that the tree may Live. And of all the descriptions of life, I believe the Viakin have the best. This Yggdrasil, the great tree grows and from its blossoms there are many worlds.
>
> But, such is the unfortunate state that somehow, somewhere, an anomaly occurred. A Being, whose name I cannot utter arose. And it began to destroy. Not kill. But destroy. A sickness upon the tree. It grew rapid, and quick. Four times. Four times before the last, Succeeded. Death, the everpresent guardian, severed the branches that were infected in the hopes that the great tree would remain healthy and strong. But, it was not to be. For though his power was great death has its limitations, but this being does not. Each time it was cast into nothing. Each time it returned.
>
> With no way to stop it a final gamble was made. The infection had made the trunk of the tree- and in the center Death took mortal form. And The Seven rose. Through every challenge, through every trial, Death's hand wielded strength to test them, to mold them, for the great Covenants that forged The Tree prevented those that were beyond his reach from helping. For Death's Gambit was not in the great powerful gods, the Cosmic Beings or even in his own hand, but rather in the smallest of things. The tiny lights upon the tree. Each soul and individual flickering. The Candle no matter how small can glow so very bright.
>
> It was there on the slopes of creation upon the very edge of night Lord Death fought one last time. He fought The Seven. The final test. For only the Covenant of Death could be broken with his failure. And so they did. And in that defeat they were removed from the tapestry. And they could fight The Enemy on equal terms. And so they did. [...]
>
> You see, The Seven had risen above any other calculation, category, or definition. And there they faced the enemy upon the shattered sky of Kalketesh. The fate of Verum was determined. And for the first time, the Enemy failed.

(Confirmation that this was The Reckoning)

> **Empress Doe**: Only those removed from mortal coils yet still remember or those that were there. [...] For you see, we had believed that victory was ours, that the great enemy was defeated, but his Herald returns. So too it would seem, that The Seven are absent. The cost of their victory too great. But, perhaps- but perhaps the gamble is on those that the torch may be passed.. I believe that it is the correct one. For mortals stopped it once, perhaps it can do so again. [...]
>
> For you see, the ephemeral forces that dictate our laws of world and magic are bound by great covenants, ionic promises, forged in the cosmic stars. The first covenant, or I suppose you might call it, was that of death to life, that he would always be its guardian. And thus the first covenant was forged. Life must die so that more life might live. And that Covenant was the last to be broken by the Seven so that they could face the Enemy.

Gruff asks about fishing for the souls of the Seven.

> **Empress Doe**: But their souls are no longer in the streams of life.
**Gruff**: But what if I fish outside of Life?<br>
**Empress Doe**: Well, if you attempted to do that you would need to first leave and only Inu knows that Gate. Inu is the guardian of Life, the counterpart to Death.

Asks where to find Inu.

> **Empress Doe**: You must go to the Shattered Gate.<br>
**Arcadum**: She’ll point her hand to the sky, the ceiling will shatter, and the sky will open, and you see the stars.<br>
**Empress Doe**: Across the astral sea.<br>
**Arcadum**: The sky looks like Bellanovan’s Star Map.

### A Violet Eye

The party is teleported away and Braktor is left behind with Empress Doe:

> **Braktor**: Oh hey what’s up?<br>
**Empress Doe**: (*Moves closer*) You. Let me see your eyes.<br>
**Braktor**: Uh. Sure?<br>
**Empress Doe**: As I suspected. The star reflects within your eyes.<br>
**Arcadum**: As the Empress places her hands upon your cheeks to look into your eyes, there is a vision.
>
> You see a vision of a rogue. You see a vision of a viking warrior. You see a vision of a construct tending to the wounds of its comrades. You see a vision of them all--other lives that you have lived, other beings that your soul has reflected within.

> **Arcadum**: Sean, the time has come. As one of the last Seven that remains, The Enemy returns, the Great Wheel begins to turn. Are you ready for what is to come?<br>
**Sean**: I mean, let’s fuckin’ do this I guess.<br>
**Arcadum**: So be it.
>
> The seven pointed star returns to its place over your left eye.

Braktor is teleported away.


### Conversation w/ A Translator

On the topic of power words.

> **Bellanoven**: Can you explain the full potential and the full repercussions of these words?<br>
**Nosfret**: To understand that, one must first understand what power is. For the words you speak are no more powerful than other words, but their meanings are less diluted. Their meanings are true, their meanings are actual. The words you speak shudder with the primal power of those that came before.<br>
**Braktor**: The Nephilim?<br>
**Nosfret**: It is said that they possessed their own language, but it has been lost. Only Seven factotums remain. And of those too few precious few can read.<br>
**Braktor**: What’s a factotum?<br>
**Nosfret**: A factotum is a representation of one’s inherent knowledge. There are Seven such spectrums that still remain.<br>
**Braktor**: One of the nephilim from what I recall was named after one of these words. Are they old?<br>
**Nosfret**: Yes, the Nephilim were the first to feel, the first to desire, formed from the primal forces.<br>
**Braktor**: I uh, I remember another one but I don’t think that I knew him by one of these names. Is it safe to speak here? Because there’s uh, some bad shit happening in your uh-<br>
**Nosfret**: Your eye reveals your nature Seven. Your kind lingers on the edge of existence. Know this: that I will keep my promise that I made to your kind, even if it means that I must deny you. You were very clear in your instructions.
