# Heart of Tyre -- Session 04

Aired: ??/??/2020

## Relevant Lore

Back in Camp Last Stand the parties are all continuing their previous conversations from other sessions (i.e. epic camp RP). One of the members of Shadow of Tyre asks if there is any person or name they may recognize from their previous quests/campaign:

> **Arcadm**: You recognize Derok Dranf. Specifically when you were shown the presence of the Seven, and Xetor revealed to you with his amber eye unleashed. There were six bindings that needed to be undone. Six paths that needed to be walked, before the Seven came into their own, and Derok Dranf belonged to the second.

Ahst will transform into Derok Dranf to see if any of the other members of the camp recognize him and instead she turns into what appears to be Antonious? When Scott (Antonius Volnarus) sees this:
> **Arcadum**: What Ahst changes into is not Antonius, but who you actually are. And when you see yourself reflected, that is, the mirror of Changeling's body, a refraction of reality occurs.<br>
<br>
Your memories come flowing back into you *Derok Dranf*. As they do this is what you remember. You remember a sister. A terrible crime performed by would be paladins of Glory. Her death, your sorrow, Crowley's call. You remember the complex where they went to perform their debauchery. You walked through the cavernous cave, deep below the Krazaxian mine. You slaughtered them all. All of them. And at the end of your bloodsoaked reverie Crowley granted you a true form. You strapped yourself onto the pillar. Blackened horns grew from your head and a flesh mask over your face. And your change to a demon was complete.<br>
<br>
Before you were banished by the Seven to Abaddon, where you were adopted by the family of those that were waiting, and took your place as a rightful prince, chosen by Crowley, before lost into the planar rifts. It all comes flowing back. You met them. You've seen them. You know them. Congratulations Jund, Antonius, Rivitah. Derok Dranf can now take his place as one of the Cardinals.

### Changeling Lore

> **Arcadum**: Ahst and Neve. Within each of your eyes the realization dawns upon you of the Enemy's use of mirrors, and what a Changeling truly is.<br>
Changelings are not but living mirrors, they are attempts by the Hagmothers to replicate the power of the stolen god. Of The Bound One. Of The Walker in Broken Glass. Tomen the Traveler.<br>
You have unlocked him officially as a new deity in Verum.
