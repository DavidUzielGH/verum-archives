### The Brass King Speaks

Seren unexpectedly passes out as the party is trying to leave the labyrinth and unbenownst to the rest of the party something reaches out and speaks into her mind:

> **Brass King**: Such an interesting thought. To enter this place. State your name, little thought. I wish to know thee.<br>
**Seren**: Uh, it's uh, Seren.<br>
**Brass King**: SEREN. SEREN. Mmm, delectable. Hello, Seren. I am the Brass King. So far away, and yet so far close you are to me.<br>
***Brass King** Maha mahe laughs(?)<br>
**Seren**: Uh, w-where are you?<br>
**Brass King**: A planet or place so far...such a waste... I can taste the earth, it fades away. But enough about where I am from, I am so much more interested in where you are from.<br>
**Seren**: Why are you so interested?<br>
**Brass King**: Because, you are like me.<br>
**Seren**: Uh. how did this happen to me?<br>
**Brass King**: That's the secret, little girl. We are inside of everything already. That was the secret that the father found.<br>
**Seren**: The...father?<br>
**Brass King**: There's so much you do not know, but do not worry child, such an occurrence is very rare. No, No, Gaze GAZE INTO MY BRAIN!<br>
**Seren**: Oh, oh oh god.<br>
**Brass King**: What do you think, of me? What do you think?<br>
**Seren**: You're uh, very, uh, very large.<br>

> **Summer**: What exactly does she see in front of her?<br>
**Arcadum**: A robed humanoid figure, in bright brass and golden hues.

> **Seren**: Very, elegant?<br>
**Brass King**: Oh, you flatter me. Well, our time is short. Your comrades will grow impatient. It is unfortunate that our conversation will be cut short, but there is something you should know, little goat girl.<br>
**Seren**: Uh huh?<br>
**Brass King**: You see, there are beings that know of The Enemy. I wonder, will your mind of balance turn away the assistance of dark forces? For we will all be needed against what is to come.<br>
**Seren**: I think that depends on what your goal is after all.<br>
**Brass King**: No need to be picky, after all, without us there will be no after.<br>
**Seren**: Then I guess there is no choice.<br>
**Brass King**: Good. Flex your little muscle, girl. It will need to be strong. Consider this, your first lesson.<br>
***Brass King** lets out a loud screech!

### Antonius' Revelation

Back in Camp Last Stand the parties are all continuing their previous conversations from other sessions (i.e. epic camp RP). One of the members of Shadow of Tyre asks if there is any person or name they may recognize from their previous quests/campaign:

> **Arcadm**: You recognize Derok Dranf. Specifically when you were shown the presence of the Seven, and Xetor revealed to you with his amber eye unleashed. There were six bindings that needed to be undone. Six paths that needed to be walked, before the Seven came into their own, and Derok Dranf belonged to the second.

Ahst will transform into Derok Dranf to see if any of the other members of the camp recognize him and instead she turns into what appears to be Antonious? When Scott (Antonius Volnarus) sees this:
> **Arcadum**: What Ahst changes into is not Antonius, but who you actually are. And when you see yourself reflected, that is, the mirror of Changeling's body, a refraction of reality occurs.
>
> Your memories come flowing back into you *Derok Dranf*. As they do this is what you remember. You remember a sister. A terrible crime performed by would be paladins of Glory. Her death, your sorrow, Crowley's call. You remember the complex where they went to perform their debauchery. You walked through the cavernous cave, deep below the Krazaxian mine. You slaughtered them all. All of them. And at the end of your bloodsoaked reverie Crowley granted you a true form. You strapped yourself onto the pillar. Blackened horns grew from your head and a flesh mask over your face. And your change to a demon was complete.
>
> Before you were banished by the Seven to Abaddon, where you were adopted by the family of those that were waiting, and took your place as a rightful prince, chosen by Crowley, before lost into the planar rifts. It all comes flowing back. You met them. You've seen them. You know them. Congratulations Jund, Antonius, Rivitah. Derok Dranf can now take his place as one of the Cardinals.

### Changeling Lore

> **Arcadum**: Ahst and Neve. Within each of your eyes the realization dawns upon you of the Enemy's use of mirrors, and what a Changeling truly is.<br>
Changelings are not but living mirrors, they are attempts by the Hagmothers to replicate the power of the stolen god. Of The Bound One. Of The Walker in Broken Glass. Tomen the Traveler.<br>
You have unlocked him officially as a new deity in Verum.
