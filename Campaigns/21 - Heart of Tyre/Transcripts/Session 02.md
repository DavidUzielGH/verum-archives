### Tyre's Journals

> **Arcadum**: You find Tyre’s journals, and they are written not in the maddening script as you might have suspected, but they are written by the wizard’s hand himself. As you begin to peruse them, it is an accounting, an accounting of his act of splitting himself into three pieces, and where those pieces went in their travels. The journal describes that Tyre’s purpose was to unravel the riddle of life and to find how it was broken.
>
> He is alluding to an event in which Life was broken, where something broke a rule. He never names what that something is, but it is clear that his search is to try and recreate, or at least understand how such a thing occurred, and as such, the three pieces traveled to three places.
>
> The first sailed the abyssal ocean, seeking the continents of Verum. The second sailed the stars, lost in a portal of dream and emotion stranded in the realm of a great whale. The third travelled to a place where Death and Life are at their highest struggles. He traveled to Azengolt, and this is the recounting of his return.
>
> **Tyre**: My journey to Azengolt revealed a few things. First, that life and death are not separate as once believed. The ancient texts of the Translators depicted that death and life are separate, that they are somehow incompatible. While that may have been true in the before time, what has been made obvious is that they are not always to do so. There are exceptions to every rule, it would seem. It was when I traveled to Azengolt where I witnessed the true conflict between life and death. I had thought that perhaps the beings there, these Depthar, might be able to teach unto me the truth. And the truth that I was taught was most certainly revealing.
>
> I spoke with a man named Crowley, a prominent scientist who explained to me how the Depthar were made. Apparently he had claimed to be the one to make them. I’m not sure how much I believe him. The man seems unstable.<br>
But in either case, it has become clear to me that however they were made, their origins not-withstanding, it is what their results are that matter to me. For any creature touched by the Depthar no longer follows the rules of Life. They live, evolve, and grow with no time nor mortal constraint. Death by injury or sickness becomes a thing of the past. Indeed, I believe that once this is perfected, eternal life will be available for all those that seek it. Normally a terrifying aspect to most, but my purpose is clear. I must find how this man broke this rule and then kill him and take it for myself. We cannot allow this rule to be broken by any that are not prepared for what will happen.

> [The next journal.]
>
> Unfortunately, it seems I had no need to kill him. Crowley was imprisoned by his own people, and as such his research was destroyed, at least they thought. I was able to procure a few samples. Once I return to Kalkatesh I shall see that this Depthar is studied with as much detail as possible.
>
> It has been a few months since I have returned to Kalkatesh and I must say, I am enthralled with these creatures. Not only are they able to consistently readapt to any situation, but the infection rate is remarkable. I believe that after several tests that they are even able to infect using the psionic empathy of the mind, avoiding physical contact entirely. Although this, albeit, is only for the strongest of them; these overminds.
>
> [And then the next journal.]
>
> Failure. Absolute failure. I have sealed the gates [to the Labyrinth]. I can only hope my other selves were more successful.
