# Heart of Tyre -- Session 18

## Relevant Lore

The party continues their fight against the Requiem Rose.

### Chosen of Iass

After three rounds Morc's ability fades, but he is granted the paragon ability as it does so, Falling Justice:

> **Arcadum**: Madd Morc, your blade's handle elongates with a silvery sheen, becoming more akin to a spear. You leap out of the blinding haze, silver fire starts to wreath along your blade as the power of Iass leaves your body. You decend down.

The ability grants him an attack against all enemies in an area with advantage, however, it does not count as an attack for mechanics that can affect that (i.e. the flower that reduces an attack's to-hit).

### The Changeling Fallout

Following events in the Living World when a group of high level characters opened a Violet chest, The Enemy was granted an opportunity to affect all changelings player characters in the world. Neve is a changeling.

And now with the fight against the Requiem Rose ended, the party moves to Neve to revive her and Koga moves to grant them their boons from his tests during the fight:

> **Arcadum**: As you move up to Neve to bring her back from the brink of death, Koga, you have tested and they have passed. As you summon up the power of the Indigo- of the color to grant them some festooned(?) boon suddenly the Neverend will hold up her hand with caution.<br>
**Neverend**: Wait, something is wrong.<br>
**Koga**: What is it?<br>
**The Dilating One**: The master *calls*.<br>
**Arcadum**: An ethereal voice will speak into the Indigo Scar. A scythe will carve a hole in reality and there a servant will unleash its strength. The Neverend will crack in twain and fall to the ground. Koga raises his daggers in time to deflect the scythe's blow, but is sent careening over the arena. Indigo light flows from his body and strikes out at the Violet presence. But, the Dilating One is too strong and Koga has slept for far too long.
>
> The arena begins to crack.<br>
The rules have changed.<br>
The creature leaves.
>
> The Scar remains. An infected wound, pulsing energy. The Indigo light washes over those that are in attendance granting them with what strength it can, for the trial continues.
>
> You receive the benefits of a long rest, but your consumables do not return.
>
> You gain a level.

Arcadum congratulates them on the victory and asks they be leveled for next session, then continues on to explain a bit more on why The Dilating One arrived:

> **Arcadum**: As the Living World and all the actions that have happened means that The Dilating One, a powerful servant, has escaped and has entered the world in service to the Master. Two Speakers now walk Kalkatesh and as such it has begun to assist its master.<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: So they see all that?<br>
**Arcadum**: Mmhmm. Unfortunately, Koga, they will also be unable to call upon your strength, for the Indigo has spent what power it can. Now, these final three fights will be on their own heroic resolve. No more chits(?). No more luck. Just them.

A final note on the remainder of the Trials:

> **Arcadum**: Koga, however, will be unable to Observe, Interfere, or Test anyone for the remainder of these fights. There is one thing he can do and we've already discussed what that is and he already knows what I'm talking about. As such, other than that, the Indigo has spent its strength and you must complete the trial. If you complete the trial then Koga will be fully awakened and he will return with all of his strength and he will name you Herald of the Indigo. Fail and- well, you shall see. Don't fail.

### Chosen of Indigo

> **Arcadum**: Ives passed three tests of the Indigo and as such, I can give him his first Chosen ability.
>
> **Indigo Torrent**:
>
> Once per combat you may activate this ability and your arrows will shine with Indigo light. Fire an attack, if this attack hits you may fire again. Repeat this process until you either miss or attack a number of times equal to your character level.
