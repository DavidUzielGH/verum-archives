### The Indigo Scar & The Neverend

Ives attempts to close a book, the spine of which reads “The Edge” and gets sucked into a realm of amethyst, with endless darkness all around it. Ives stands before a strange creature:

> **Ives**: Am I dead?<br>
> **Arcadum**: The creature will shake its head.<br>
**Ives**: Am I about to be?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will put its finger to its cheek in a thinking manner. It will place its hand out in front of it and as it reveals its hand you will see that its hand is bandaged- wrapped in bandages all the way through, along its hands and fingers. And it will simply hold its hand out palm face down, and wriggle its hand back and forth.<br>
**Ives**: Who are you?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will hold out its hand, its left hand specifically, palm up.<br>

Ives will look at it, and look at the three eyed creature, once back to the hand before letting out a very large sigh, and slinging his bow. Ives then takes the creature’s hand with his right hand.

> **Arcadum**: The hand will lightly, so small, so frail, wrap itself around yours. She will place her other hand atop your hand, palm down. Her eyes, all three, will close. And then, you will hear a voice in you head.<br>
**The Neverend**: Do not fear, you are in a place that is safe.<br>
**Ives**: What about everything outside of this place?<br>
**The Neverend**: Safety is a difficulty concept. But for now, you are safe.<br>
**Ives**: Can you tell me what this place is?<br>
**The Neverend**: This is the Indigo Scar. It is what I have guarded, what I have kept watch.<br>
**Ives**: Oh boy, what is the Indigo Scar?<br>
**The Neverend**: Hmm, a requirement for what is to come.<br>
**Ives**: And what’s to come?<br>
**The Neverend**: The end. It is my duty to see that never is the end. But I am doomed to fail, it would seem.<br>
**Ives**: What do you mean?<br>
**The Neverend**: Each time I have tried, the end came all the same. With each iteration, the wheel kept turning. Again, and again, and again.<br>
**Ives**: How many times?<br>
**The Neverend**: We are upon the sixth iteration. I fear that should we fail this time, what waits us on the other end is the doom of all. I am uncertain if this is the last chance, but that is a dangerous game. And I do not wish to gamble creation.<br>
**Ives**: Well that’s why I’m here, I think. Your cause is our cause.<br>
**The Neverend**: Indeed. The iterations have done what they can, the prism has refracted as much as it can. But we are on the last, each color has expended its strength, except for this place. The sixth was indigo, and the seventh is the traitor. This may be the last chance we have.<br>
**Ives**: You’ve seen five other failed attempts? How do we succeed where they failed?<br>
**The Neverend**: Hmm, you.<br>
**Ives**: I don’t understand.<br>
**The Neverend**: Hmm, there is always a you. In each iteration. There is always… a you. There is always- there is always an Indigo. Each time, failure. Each time, corruption. Each time, suffering. You have not refracted, but I can see beyond.<br>

> **Arcadum**: And with that, she will look past Ives, and rather into the soul that inhabits him. The gaze of the Neverend watches you, little soul, not quite as big as the others, not yet refracted, but yet burdened with terrible purpose. The Neverend returns its gaze to Ives.

> **The Neverend**: We are in the end now and all things lie in jeopardy. It is my purpose to test your… power, strength, endurance, courage, all the things that you are. Your might must be tested. And the power of the Indigo will find its way to you.<br>
**Ives**: How do I do that?<br>
**The Neverend**: Look below your feet, these are the failed Indigos. To claim the strength of the scar, you must defeat them.<br>
***Ives** will look down.<br>

> **Snake (Ives)**: You said it was glowing before?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep, and now you know what the glows are. They are but souls. Failed souls, souls that did not succeed the test of the indigo.

> **Ives**: So if I fail here I become one of them?<br>
**The Neverend**: Yes, you do. I can sense your longing of your comrades, do not fear, they will be here soon.<br>
***Ives** will kneel down with purpose and lay a gloved hand on the indigo crystal below him. And after a few seconds, he will rise again.<br>
**Ives**: Well, I guess this fate’s better than that one.<br>
***Ives** gestures a thumb at the endless nothing around him.<br>
**The Neverend**: Indeed, aspirant. Shall I fetch your comrades?<br>
***Ives** will exhale, and then nod.

The rest of the Tops will get teleported into the Indigo Scar

> **Derok**: Ives, are you okay?<br>
**Ives**: First of all, I’m sorry.<br>
**Derok**: For what? Where the hell are we? What the hell is this?

**Summer (Seren)**: I’m freaking ouuuut

> **The Neverend**: Greetings comrades of the aspirant.<br>
**Seren**: Oh…hello.<br>
**Morc**: Hello.<br>
**The Neverend**: You are to assist him in what is to come.<br>
**Seren**: What?<br>
***Derok** will look to Ives to ascertain the situation.<br>
***Ives** will give Derok a look that says to go with it.<br>
**Derok**: So what’s been going on here?<br>
**Morc**: What are we assisting him with?<br>
**The Neverend**: The one known as Ives has taken the initiative to be tested to receive the power of the Indigo Scar, however, one must prove thyself’s might to receive such strength.<br>
**Seren**: What’s Indigo Scar?<br>
**The Neverend**: Should he fail, he will join the souls below.<br>
**Derok**: And you agreed to this?<br>
**Ives**: Look down. Those are all the people, the souls, that tried this test before. All for the same goal. This – this being here told me that what we’re doing now has happened five times already, we’re the sixth. The seventh is…that’s…we’re the last hope.<br>
**Seren**: Uhhhhhhh.<br>
**Neve**: You mean that endless wheel isn’t so endless?<br>
**Ives**: That’s what I’m gathering.<br>
**Neve**: Right, well we’ve been through a lot already I guess, what’s one more test?<br>
**Ives**: I’m not going to make any of you do this without – without your approval – you have to agree.<br>
**Morc**: You helped me with my ascension.<br>
**Neve**: Who are you kidding, how could we not agree? Hey last time we were begging you to stay, you don’t have to ask me.<br>
**Derok**: You literally jumped into hell for us.<br>
***Derok** will stand at Ives side.<br>
**Morc**: As if we’d say no.<br>

> **Summer (Seren)**: Are we gonna do the thing? Everybody put your hands in, and we make a special sign!

> **Morc**: Tops save the world.<br>
**Seren**: 1 2 3 Tops tops tops tops<br>
**Morc**: Tops tops tops tops tops tops tops tops tops<br>
***Morc** squints at Ives.<br>
**Morc**: Say it.<br>
**Seren**: Say it. Ives I’m still mad, say it.<br>
**Neve**: This happens every time.<br>
**Ives**:…Tops.<br>
**Morc**: There we go, that’s all you gotta say<br>

Derok will give Seren a potion of bless, and will chug one himself

> **Seren**: Oh.<br>
***The Neverend** will hold up its hand.<br>
**The Neverend**: Hold upon thy preparations.<br>
***Derok** will spit the bless potion back it.<br>
**The Neverend**: Fear not.<br>
***The Neverend** will snap its fingers, and the potions are refilled.<br>
**The Neverend**: All things are fair in the Scar.<br>
**Seren**: I have a question for you.<br>
**The Neverend**: Speak.<br>
**Seren**: How long have you existed?<br>
**The Neverend**: For as long as the Scar.<br>
**Ives**: What made the Scar?<br>
**The Neverend**: The first iteration.<br>
**Ives**: So did the Scar create you, or were you created by something else?<br>
**The Neverend**: I cannot answer this, even with the Cardinal present.<br>
**Derok**: Wait, when did the last iteration end?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature is silent.<br>
> **Derok**: What if I’ve been alive throughout multiple iterations? There was no reset, it’s just been me, what does that mean?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature does not answer.<br>
**Seren**: Is…is this supposed to be a part of The Edge?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature does not answer.<br>
**The Neverend**: It is time. I will now explain your trial.<br>

Six pillars of amethyst will summon up from the crystals, all around you.

> **The Neverend**: Your test is presented before you, these foes you shall face. You shall have some manner of choosing what you wish to face. When you have defeated them all, the power of the Indigo is yours.
