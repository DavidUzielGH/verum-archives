### A Depthar Documentary from Azengolt

> **Arcadum**: The centurion will begin to point itself at a flat part of the wall and will project images, moving images, on the wall. Not unlike the illusion magics that you’ve seen on your adventures. You will also hear soft sounds being mimicked from the creature. Of voices, of rain, of footsteps, and cries of pain.
>
> The sky was grey and cold, the day the Depthar came. For years, the Precepts had been fighting, fighting over who would rule the fate of Azengolt. They cared not for the cost of the land, they cared not for the cost of the mana, they cared not for the cost people whose lives were wasted in their endless game of tug and war. For they were Eldar, infinite of life, long of grudge. They used the lives of others like spent torches, they drained the land of its power and strength in their constant need to dominate each other.
>
> And that was the day that the Depthar came. Each world as it floats through the astral sea, is protected, protected by a thin shield of Leylinic strength, known as its shell. This shell prevents... things from getting inside and it prevents things from escaping. Balance- balance is required for a shell to function. For the more out of balance a world becomes the thinner its shell. And the more of the world that is consumed the weaker the shell. Azengolt had long since abandoned the need for druids, the study of the green, the need for balance. The shell was weakened. The Precepts drained whatever energy they could find form the land, using it without second thought. The shell was weakened. Finally, one such thing approached Azengolt. Whereas before it would have been deflected, it would have been defeated, it would have been prevented, it was not. The meteor came. Just a simple point of bright light, piercing through the shale, and falling to Azengolt.
>
> A simple, errant thing it was, on that cold and rainy night. For a flaming rock sizzled and steamed and an unsuspecting peasant reached inside to see. It happened fast. It happened unseen. The Depthar spread. With each spreading it became more powerful. With each added soldier to its ranks its mind expanded. And in their arrogance the Precepts thought it was one another that were using such a weapon and instead of attempting to destroy it, to cull the infection, they attempted to capture it so that they might recreate what their enemies had made. Each capture, each attempt to replicate this strange creature, each one took its toll and its cost. The Depthar were not stopped.
>
> And then the Depthar found their first Eldar. It is here it is said that Crowley the Eldar first attempted to create his own and it is here that the Depthar, perhaps, received their first true evolution. For although he was careful for himself Crowley would do anything to prove himself. Anything to be more than he was. Anything to raise his status. And so, Crowley took his brother into the dark. And when he left he left on his own and in his hand a simple vial. A vial of strength. A vial of power. A vial of madness. For the Depthar have but one strength. The longer they are alive the stronger they become. However, what happens when you infect a creature that lives forever?
>
> And so, Crowley disappeared from the world of Azengolt, suffice to hide away with his experiments, while his brethren faced the growing threat. It is said in the era of twilight when the Depthar had risen beyond control that life finally took its stand against death. And for generations upon generations life fought death. And lost. Each of the bastion cities, once that stood 12 strong, beacons of light and life against the encroaching, swollen darkness, fell.
>
> One by one. Until naught but three remained. And then, on the anniversary of the comet’s fall in the grand irony of shifting time, Crowley emerged from his laboratory. No longer was he Eldar. Now he was something else. Something else entirely. It was then that Crowley would finally achieve that which he sought, finally have that which he wanted more than anything else, he would have his experiment. And thus, he released it into the world. As he did so he was captured by his kind and he was imprisoned. Imprisoned in a place where never again would he see the light of day, never again would his mind be free to wander of questions, and never again will he see the secrets of the world. But their efforts were too late, for Crowley’s experiment had finished and the Depthar, once an infection, fought with diligence, fought with medicine, fought with comradery, had now evolved to something greater than itself. The first Overmind was born.
>
> With the introduction of the Overminds all seemed lost. The bastion cities held on for what they had left, but the new enemy was smart. It could see. It could infect with errant thoughts. However, as the Depthar began to develop personality, began to develop desire, perhaps it was the madness of their creator or a hidden compassion left behind, but the Depthar did not finish the job they started. The Overmind stepped away from the stage of the world and allowed life a chance to recover. And thus, the process has repeated, step by step, piece by piece. It is believed by the observers, those that watch, that the living are allowed to live by the great Overminds. For the Depthar will always need fresh stock, they would always need replacements, they would always need new seeds. For the Overmind already knew that life on Azengolt was defeated and instead turned its wriggling mass towards the stars.
