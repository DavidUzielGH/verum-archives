### Koga Arrives

> **Arcadum**: The Neverend watches from far atop the Indigo Scar, observing the movements, carefully analyzing, tracking & judging the decisions and strengths made for those below.<br>
Suddenly, she will turn with a startle and realizes she has not been alone for some time. The Neverend will turn and will look with surprise and will then immediately kneel and bow before the man seated upon crystal and stone.

> **Neverend**: Lord Indigo, you- you are not supposed to be awakened until the trial is finished. Has something happened?<br>
**Koga**: Something else.

> **Todd (Koga)**: Do I recognize this being?<br>
> **Arcadum**: Yes you do, well not really. Many years ago, we had many servants in Tyr’s Drop. There were many drow. This is one of those drow or rather the descendant of one. You recognize within her eyes, blessed was she by the ancient spider goddess who has been wiped from the current cycles. But, you recognize an old tattoo upon her shoulder. One marking not that of Iass, but that of patronage. This is the daughter. You're not quite sure- grandaughter, or how many generations but, she bears the same mark. The Daughter: Jarlaxel.

> **Koga**: What is going on here?<br>
**Neverend**: They have taken your trial. One seeks to become your champion. They do not know the full extent. I have told them only what is needed to be known; as per your instructions.<br>
**Arcadum**: She will point downwards and summon a small portal for vision. Koga will see the face of Ives below. His face grim and his bow taut, struggling and fighting.<br>
**Neverend**: This is one that will seek to be your Herald.<br>
**Koga**: Let’s see what he’s got.<br>
**Neverend**: Very well my lord.

---

> **Arcadum**: Koga now has initiative on the battlefield. He has three actions he can take.
>
>\> **Observe**: Allows for Koga to use a reaction at any point of the fight to reroll any [d20] of his choice. Enemy or ally.
>
>\> **Test**: Koga can choose to enact Indigo power upon any of the player characters present. They must make a DC 20 Saving throw [of Arcadum's choosing?]. If they fail, they are stunned. If they succeed, then they gain a boon at the end of the fight. Ives has advantage on this roll.
> 
>\> **Interference**: Koga will instead effect the enemy's rolls in the same manner. This can cause the enemy to miss or fail. Koga is equal to Violet, not stronger. For each movement means that the enemy moves as well. Every interference will mean that the Violet gains 1 point of Entropy.

He only has access to one of these per round.

### Derok Clashes The Violet Directly

> **Arcadum**: Derok Dranf will approach the Violet Servant and seek the challenge the Herald's strength; the violet light directly. Derok's soul glows in a shape of a Cardinal. Koga knows it to be something else. He recognizes it to be an old heraldy. One of a warrior who's valor was scared by the many battles he had fought through. A warrior long since put to the rest. The violet light descends down on the Cardinal's stance. His strength like a flame before a hurricane. 
>
> Now you have your choice. Do you wish to intefere or allow this one to stand on its own merit? Remember, that inteference grants me strength. What will it be Indigo?<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: I'll say under my breath:

> **Koga**: Scarred Valor...<br>
**Arcadum**: With the power word spoken a warrior from the past, beyond the cycle, stands with its heraldry blazing in the sun- raises its banner and stands before the Violet enemy. Indigo light begins to glow from with in it, manifesting it completely.<br>
> **Koga**: One of the truest warriors I ever knew.

Instead of the magical clash Derok originally sought, with Koga's aid, it now becomes a soul-check clash.

They roll:

**Derok**: [d20+10] ==> `(7+10) ==> 17`<br>
**Koga**: [d20+35] ==> `(1+35) ==> 36` ===> Naomi's BDay `20` ==> `(20+35) ==> 55`

**Requiem Rose**: [d20+24] ==> `(16+24) ==> 40`

> **Arcadum**: The Indigo power surges through the mysterious manifested warrior that walks within. Derok Dranf is surrounded in a mystical veil of honor and armor. It shines with light. The hammer transforms into a banner and upon the symbol of the Cardinals, but as it once was. Not the symbol of ancient order, but the symbol of one man who wanted to make the world a better place. A symbol of hope. A symbol that some have forgotten. Derok Dranf wields the banner and with all of its glory smashes it into the light.
>
> The Violet cracks. The Requiem's face, a perfect mask of serene beauty, begins cracks. Indigo pierces violet and the strength of the blow washes over the Requiem. Therefore, in an errant scream, silent and stolen, the creature stumbles backwards. Leaves wilt. Flowers fade. Its strength nearly depleted. It tries to stand, but it cannot. Finally, the light clears from the eyes of all those present.
>
> No longer blinded and there they witness the injured and nearly defeated Requiem Rose. She stands barely. Cracked. Broken. Her right arm missing. Violet light eeking out a mysterious ichor that forms at the bottom. Her visage of beauty all but removed.

They succeed and are awarded the ability to seal one of the Rose's inititives. The group discusses and chooses to seal the Vanity inititive.

> **Arcadum**: The warrior bathed in Indigo will fade back into the past once more remembered by very, very few. The mark of a Cardnial shines bright with light.<br>
**Koga**: Bye, old friend.

### The TPK That Wasn't

Requiem Rose falls to her HP threshold after the clash with Derok and the Indigo and in doing so unleashes her ability `The Herald Remembers` (5hp of poison damage per destroyed flower in the fight; they destroyed 29). All but Neve and Derok are downed.

(Naomi stopped by #SSC after session to give some insight on Neve's thoughts at this time\*)
> ***Neve** begins to weep at her uselessness in aiding her closest companions<br>
**Neve**: (*Internal*) I shouldn't have shot- I've ruined everything... Derok just did so much and I- Why am *I* still standing when they're all down? ... Where's Morc?<br>
***Neve** looks around frantically and runs to Morc, hoping to heal him<br>
**Neve**: (*Internal*) I have to heal him. He's always standing strong, always saving us all. He can fix this.

The Requiem Rose now goes.
> **Arcadum**: Wounded, it's arm ruined, it will raise up it's `Spindles` and target [Seren].

Seren is down and auto-fails one death saving throw.

Ives now makes his death saving throw and uses a Lucky (both failures). Koga uses `Observe` to grant Ives a reroll (18). One save.

Morc's turn. Natural 20. He arises! Awakens even...

> **Neve**: (*Internal*) He's up! He's alive! He... didn't need me...<br>
***Neve**: turns toward Ives with her potion, resolved to do what little she can.

> **Arcadum**: This is a trial of Iass. As you have risen from death with a natural 20, that counts as another prerequisite for the chosen of Iass. You rise with glowing hair. Silver strength, and the symbol of Iass pumping across his chess. Your armor is broken. Your hat is disheveled. Your eye patch falls away and burns bright.

Morc inhales a double-green herb healing 90 then rushes towards Seren, just within range for Healing word. ([d4+1] ==> `4+1 ==> 5`)

> **Morc**: RISE!

Seren is back.

He gains another action. Morc moves with in 10 feet of the Requiem Rose.
> **Arcadum**: Morc's silver hair shines in the Indigo light, his blade pulsing with silver fire.

Her next inititive she chooses to clash with Morc using `Cracking Will`.

> **Arcadum**: With one arm, the Violet lights will course down the Requiem Rose and will reach out towards Morc who raises his blade to defend himself. The Violet will course through the creature's hand as it places it right on top of the blade. The blade will start to crack. Morc will put all of his strength into his eye. His will start to crack. Visions of despair. All around him he sees it.
>
> Reality begins to bend, the dream, the waking realm. He sees his comrades fall. He sees Seren succumb to the being within. He sees Derok as a smouldering white ashen pile. He sees Ives hanging from a tree. He sees all these punnishments, all of these deaths, all of these futures.
>
> However, hope is not so easily extinguished.
>
> The realities contort and twist back to where they belonged. What "is", is simple. He feels the steel in his hand, the blood in his body. His heart yet still beats. His lungs yet still pull in breath. His eye shines with Violet light. And he swings his weapon.
>
> The hand of the Requiem Rose falls to the ground. She stumbles back. A gamble lost.

**Morc**: [d20+13] ==> `(14+13) ==> 27`<br>
**Requiem Rose**: [d20+16] ==> `(9+16) ==> 25`

Morc is granted the option to seal an ability. The party debates and settles on `The Herald Remembers` to seal.

> **Arcadum**: The Violet light around the Requiem fades. Dims. Becomes weaker. Her power wanes. She reaches out towards the violet light and there is nothing there any longer.

### Chosen of Iass

Morc's special form, The Chosen of Iass, awakened again when Morc rolled the natural `20` for his death saving throw:

Abilities:<br>
> **Spear**: Everyone that has a melee/ranged weapon may attack at this time, but only within range.
>
>**Scales**: Balance will manifest. They may choose to sacrifice a number of hit points to heal one ally that is seeable. However, the hit points given are evenly distributed.
>
>**Shield**: Choose one ally. They become immune to damage for 1 Round.

Due to rolling another natural `20` & chosing to use `Scales` while in this form he unlocks the ability permanently, having now used all 3 abilities. He may use it once (likely per long rest) and gains this form for up to 3 rounds.
