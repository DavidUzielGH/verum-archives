### Koga Arrives

> **Arcadum**: The Neverend watches far atop the Indigo Scar, observing the movements, carefully analyzing, judging their decisions for the strength for those above.<br>
Suddenly, she turns and realizes she has not been alone for some time. The Neverend will turn and will look with surprise. She will immediately kneel and bow. (...) seated upon crystal and stone.

> **Neverend**: Lord Indigo, you...you are not supposed to be awakened until the trial is finished. Has something happened?<br>
**Koga**: Something else.

> **Todd (Koga)**: Do I recognize this being?<br>
> **Arcadum**: Yeah you do, but not really. Many years ago, we had many servants in Tyr’s drops. There were many drow. This is one of those drow or rather the descendant in one. You recognize in her eyes, blessed by an ancient spider goddess, you recognize an old tattoo. Not one of Iass, but of her old patronage. She bears the mark Jdraxil.

> **Koga**: What is going on here?<br>
**Neverend**: They have taken your trial. One seeks to become your champion. They do not know the full extent. I have only told them what is needed to be known; as per your instructions.<br>
**Arcadum**: She will kneel downwards and summon a small portal of her vision. Koga will see the face of Ives below. His face grim and his bow taut.<br>
**Neverend**: This is one that will seek to be your Herald.<br>
**Koga**: Let’s see what he’s got.<br>
**Neverend**: Very well my lord.

---

> **Arcadum**: Koga now has initiative on the battlefield. He has three actions he can take.
>
> **Observe**: Allows for Koga to use a reaction at any point of the fight to reroll any dice of his choice. Enemy or ally.
>
> **Test**: Koga can choose to enact Indigo power upon any of the player characters present. They must make a DC 20 Intelligence Saving throw. If they fail, they are stunned. If they succeed, then they gain a boon at the end of the fight. Ives has advantage on this roll.
> 
> **Interference**: Koga will instead effect the enemy's rolls in the same manner. This can cause the enemy to miss or fail. Koga is equal to Violet, not stronger. For each movement means that the enemy moves as well. Every interference will mean that the Violet gains 1 point of Entropy.

He only has access to one of these per round.

### Derok Clashes The Violet Directly

> **Arcadum**: Derok Dranf will approach the Violet Servant and seek the challenge the Herald's strength. The violet light directly. Derok's soul glows in a shape of a Cardinal. Koga knows it to be something else. He recognizes it to be an old heraldy. One of a warrior who's valor was scared by the many battles he had fought through. A warrior long since put to the rest. The violet light descends down on the Cardinal's stance. His strength like a flame before a hurricane. 
>
> Now you have your choice. Do you wish to intefere or allow this one to stand on its own merit? Remember, that inteference grants me strength. What will it be Indigo?<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: I'll say under my breath:

> **Koga**: Scarred Valor...

(more here)

Instead of the magical clash Derok originally sought, with Koga's aid, it now becomes a soul-check clash.

They roll:

**Derok**: [d20+10] ==> `(7+10) ==> 17`<br>
**Koga**: [d20+35] ==> `(1+35) ==> 36` ===> Naomi's BDay `20` ==> `(20+35) ==> 55`

**Requiem Rose**: [d20+24] ==> `(16+24) ==> 40`

> **Arcadum**: The Indigo power surges through the mysterious manifested warrior that walks within. Derok Dranf is surrounded in a mystical veil of honor and armor. It shines with light. The hammer transforms into a banner and upon the symbol of the Cardinals, but as it once was. Not the symbol of ancient order, but the symbol of a man trying to make the world a better place. A symbol of hope. A symbol that some have forgotten. Derok Dranf wields the banner and with all of his glory, smashes it into the light.
>
> The Violet cracks. The Requiem is one of serene beauty, but cracks. Indigo pierces violet and the strength of the blow washes over the Requiem. Therefore, in an errant scream, silent and stolen, the creature stumbles backwards. Leaves wilt. Flowers fade. Its strength nearly depleted. It tries to stand, but it cannot. Finally, the light clears from all those present.
>
> No longer blinded and there they witness the injured and nearly defeated Requiem Rose. She stands barely. Cracked. Broken. Her right arm is missing. Violet light eeking out and a mysterious ichor that forms at the bottom. Her visage of beauty all but removed.

They succeed and are awarded the ability to seal one of the Rose's inititives. The group discusses and chooses to seal the Vanity inititive.

### The TPK That Wasn't

Requiem Rose falls to her HP threshold after the clash with Derok and the Indigo and in doing so unleashes her ability `The Herald Remembers` (5hp per destroyed flower in the fight; they destroyed 29). All but Neve and Derok are downed.

Neve moves away, up towards Morc and Ives to assist them on her next turn.

The Requiem Rose now goes, she targets Seren with her attack. Seren is down and auto-fails one death saving throw.

Ives now makes his death saving throw (two failures). Koga uses `Observe` to grant Ives a reroll (18). One save.

Morc's turn. Natural 20. He arises! Awakens even...

> **Arcadum**: This is a trial of Iass. As you have risen from death with a natural 20, that counts as another prerequisite as a chosen of Iass. You rise with glowing hair. Silver strength, and the symbol of Iass pumping across his chess. Your hat is broken. Your chest is disheveled. Your eye patch falls away and burns bright.

Morc inhales a double-green herb healing 90 then rushes towards Seren, just within range for Healing word. ([d4+1] ==> `4+1 ==> 5`)

> **Morc**: AWAKEN!

Seren is back.

He gains another action. Morc moves with in 10 feet of the Requiem Rose. Her next inititive she chooses to clash with Morc.

> **Arcadum**: With one arm, the Violet lights with course down the Requiem Rose who raises his blade to defend him. The Violet courses the creature's hand as he places it right on top of the blade. Morc will put all of his strength into his eye. His will start to crack. Visions of despair. All around him he sees it.
>
> Reality begins to bend, the dream, the waking realm. He sees his comrades fall. He sees Seren succumb to the being within. He sees Derok as a smouldering pile. He sees Ives hanging from a tree. He sees all of these deaths. He sees all of these futures.
>
> However, hope is not so easily extinguished.
>
> Realities contort and go back to where they belonged. What is simple. He feels his hands. He feels his blood through his body. His lungs are still pulsing with breath. His eyes shine with Violet light, and swings his weapon.
>
> The hand of the Requiem Rose falls to the ground. She stumbles back. A gamble lost.

**Morc**: [d20+13] ==> `(14+13) ==> 27`<br>
**Requiem Rose**: [d20+16] ==> `(9+16) ==> 25`

Morc is granted the option to seal an ability. The party debates and settles on The Herald Remembers to seal.

> **Arcadum**: The Violet light around the Requiem fades. Dims. Becomes weaker. Her power wanes. She reaches out towards the violet light, and there is nothing there any longer.

### Chosen of Iass

Morc's special form, The Chosen of Iass, awakened when Morc rolled the natural `20` for his death saving throw:

Abilities:<br>
> **Spear**: Everyone that has a melee/ranged weapon may attack at this time, but only within’ range.
>
>**Scales**: Balance will manifest. They may choose to sacrifice a number of hit points to heal one ally that is seeable. However, the hit points given are evenly distributed.
>
>**Shield**: Choose one ally. They become immune to damage for 1 Round.

Due to his actions after attaining the form this fight he unlocks the ability permanently. He may use it once (likely per long rest) and gains this form for up to 3 rounds.
