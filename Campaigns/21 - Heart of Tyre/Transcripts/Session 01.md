### Erin Inspects Morc's Eye

> **Morc**: “Do you know much about violet? Is there a way to contain it within myself?”<br>
**Erin**: Um. “Do you want to do an experiment?”<br>
**Morc**: “Hmm. Yes.”<br>
**Erin**: “Let me see that eye.”<br>
**Morc**: Alright, and he’ll take off Hoto’s eyepatch.<br>
**Erin**: Erin will cast true sight and look into his eye.<br>

Arcadum makes distressed noises and everyone laments what’s coming.

(The stream is sent to the break screen)

Arcadum and Ster determine how many campaigns Ster has been in, counting Ashen Veil, Crimson Sands, Trouble in Trisden, Trial by Fire, Old Thrones, Gailen’s Gate, Shattered Crowns, The Inquisition, Gleis Expedition, and Holmgard and Beyond. Making it 10.

> **Arcadum**: As you look into Madd Morc’s eye and it begins to refract and you begin to see the truth of things. True sight, accompanied with Erin’s knowledge as the deep prophet, accompanied with his level, accompanied with the player’s strength in terms of knowledge and how many games played, I give you this one opportunity. You may ask my two questions and I will answer them.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Right now?<br>
**Arcadum**: Right now.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: In front of chat?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes. Keep in mind, if you ask me the wrong question, every campaign will end.<br>

All react with varying levels of incredulity and joke about it.

> **Arcadum**: Whatever question you ask me, I will answer.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Do you want me to ask from the perspective of what Erin wants to know or what Ster wants to know?<br>
**Arcadum**: You. I’m talking to you, not Erin. So, two questions. There are six questions that if you ask me something terrible will happen, truly terrible, and one of them will be that I will end every campaign. I do not have the option to not answer you.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: I have enough player knowledge to guess what one or two of those is.<br>
**Arcadum**: Good. It means you have the best chance of not asking them.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Um, I also am going to feel really guilty if I sit here and think about this but I don’t think that any of you would hold it against me.<br>

(All reassure Ster that it’s fine)

> **Ster (Erin)**: I just, I really feel bad, I came in here and fucked up your whole campaign with like seeing the everything.<br>
**Russ (Morc)**: Takes two to tango. I’m here, so I’m also responsible for this.<br>

(People joke about the situation)

> **Naomi (Neve)**: Is not asking not an option?<br>
**Arcadum**: He can throw the questions away by asking something innocuous, so he could always bail out, but he’s in a position that he could learn some truly meaningful things. But the problem is is that because his player strength is enough in terms of knowledge and understanding, I don’t have anything gated now.<br>
**Strippin (Ahst)**: He is the strongest of us.<br>
**Arcadum**: No, but he’s strong enough.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Every question that I’m coming up with is world ending for sure.

(Some comment about the situation)

> **Sean (Braktor)**: Honestly, I’m just glad it’s not fuckin’ me.<br>
**Arcadum**: Poor Sean.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: I have a question, I have a good one.<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Because I know this is what probably all my characters ultimately would want to know, and what I want to know, and I want to make sure it’s phrased properly before I end the world. Also, because I’m answering this on stream, how is this in terms of everyone else hearing the answer? Does like everyone know? Is that a meta thing?<br>
**Arcadum**: It depends on what you ask. If I have to mute stream, I will.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Uh, okay, here’s the question. What is the most effective way for a mortal to control the violet?

(Others discuss the question)

> **Arcadum**: Only one controls the violet. That’s the answer.<br>
**Scott (Antonius)**: Okay, out of character, I feel like we know the answer to that, right?<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: I do.<br>
**Scott (Antonius)**: Does it rhyme with shmord shmeath?<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: It rhymes with mhah mheh.<br>
**Arcadum**: One question remains. Man I wish Moon was here.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Hm. Yeah he would probably come up with a good one. I have- I have a bunch, I’m just- two questions, it’s not- it’s not a lot but also it’s- it’s enough to do a lot of damage.<br>
**Arcadum**: It’s not enough but it’s too much. (*Laughs*) That does not mean go bother him during his stream, chat, do not do that.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Okay, I kinda have to follow up because that’s not enough. Um, phrasing. How is it that this one particular individual has grown capable of using the violet where others cannot?

(Others joke about the question)

> **Sean (Braktor)**: You’re not gonna like the answer.<br>
**Russ (Morc)**: We all just get disconnected and Arcadum goes dark.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: No, I just mean if it’s what I think it is it’s not a satisfying answer.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: I don’t expect that it will be but I kinda have to try.<br>
**Strippin (Ahst)**: What if he just says "cause I fuckin’ said so"?

(Dramatic long pause)

> **Arcadum**: So be it.<br>

(Pause again, people joke about possible impending doom)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, this is the answer to that question. The violet and this one are the same. One controls oneself. One gained the violet by the shattering of a covenant.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: That’s actually a pretty good answer.

(More chatter about the answer)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, and as the second question is asked, Erin is knocked backwards from the power, slamming against the fountain. Morc is knocked backwards, falling to the ground. A flash of violet light emanates from the area. One moment please.

More chatter. Arcadum orders every RP channel in the Discord to be double barred, preventing all further role play until it is lifted, and puts out this announcement

> **Arcadum**: There is a flash of violet light across the entirety of Kalkatesh, a bolt of violet lightning strikes down at the Arcane Labyrinth, The Herald grows closer, the world shudders and the gods look towards the Astral Sea.

All channels are then unbarred.

(Others lament the possible destruction of the Living World)

> **Ster (Erin)**: I got a lot out of that answer. I can’t- I can’t say any of it, but I got a lot out of it.<br>

(Others respond generally with “Good for you”)

> **Ronnie (Ozzie)**: I mean, does Erin know it? Erin can tell us stuff.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Well, he wouldn’t. He absolutely wouldn’t either.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: You would die.

---

> **Arcadum**: Okay. There is a flash of violet light as a violet lightning bolt hurtles down through the astral sea and pierces the sky of Kalkatesh. It strikes the encampment. It rebounds off of a spherical presence as the Vizier holds up his staff, attempting to do what he can in place of Lord Azalon to hold back the dangerous power. The shield, thankfully, does not falter. The eye, The Herald, grows closer, empowered and hungry, like a rabid wolf at the door. You now have its attention, and as such, for the remainder of the Trials of Tyre, I will hide within them violet enemies.
>
> If you defeat them, you can slow The Herald’s progress. If you do not defeat them, it will hasten it. These enemies carry with them the cost of Violet Death and they are powerful. They are not leveled to you. If you choose to face one, you must do so with great caution. In exchange for this cost, you have gained a piece of knowledge that if properly followed may grant the forces of creation a great boon against the enemy. But now you must walk the razor’s edge between knowledge and faith. Erin and Madd Morc recover. You may continue.

> **Morc**: What in the goddamn?!<br>
**Erin**: Oh that was uh, that was a pretty good experiment. That was good.<br>
**Ives**: We good? That didn’t look good.

(Seren, Neve, and Antonius react in a similar negative way)

> **Morc**: Antonius. Do I still have it in me? Did it escape?<br>

> **Scott (Antonius)**: I’ll look at his eye. Well, I mean, I’ll look to see if there’s violet light emanating from behind his eyepatch.<br>
**Arcadum**: Behind the eyepatch? No.

> **Antonius**: I don’t know if I want to look.<br>
**Morc**: Then… you must not. Let’s not mess with it then.<br>
**Erin**: Bruh, I’m gonna give it to you guys straight. This seems really bad and I may have, uh, fuddled with our current predicament here, but uh, it’s really only because he’s scared. You gotta look at it that way. The shit I learned from that. He better stop us now, you know what I mean?<br>
**Seren**: Did you just call the giant thing in the sky scared of us?<br>
**Erin**: Well yeah.<br>
**Braktor**: I mean, why wouldn’t he be?<br>
**Erin**: He’s just a guy. The more you figure out that he’s nothing, then the more he’s gonna come and try and kill us quickly.<br>
**Antonius**: This is all so much.<br>
**Ives**: Yeah explain to me why that’s a good thing.<br>
**Braktor**: If I might, sorry, I hate to interrupt. You have to understand something. This isn’t the sort of thing that’s afraid of anything- it’s just- you’re not afraid of something that’s not a threat to you. We are a threat to it. We can do something about it. The last things to do that were The Seven.<br>
**Morc**: And do we know what happened to them?<br>
**Braktor**: I mean, I do.<br>
**Antonius**: Wait, how?<br>
**Braktor**: I- I- Look, I want you to promise that you’ll keep an open mind, but um… You know all this refraction stuff?<br>
**Ives**: No.<br>
**Antonius**: Of course.<br>
**Morc**: Yes.<br>
**Braktor**: I used to- I used to be a Seven. I was with you, in your fight, in the Dream. That was one of me.<br>
**Seren**: Archdruid! (Bow. Bow bow bow bow.)<br>
**Antonius**: Wait. How would you- how did you know about our fight, how-<br>
**Morc**: Were you the sexy lady with the abs?<br>
**Seren**: No, not Nox-<br>
**Braktor**: Gods I wish.<br>
**Morc**: Oh yeah, me too.<br>
**Erin**: He was the dinosaur.<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah, that. But, the thing is, they’re not- they’re not gods.<br>
**Antonius**: Is that not what you- I-I-I don’t understand, was it actually, physically you, or do you- are you multiple people, I don’t-<br>
**Morc**: Are you a druid like Seren?<br>
**Braktor**: No, no no no, I’ve been- I’m a cleric of The Seven, ironically. The refractions, they’re you, they’re just different parts of you. When you- when you fight, and persist, and survive, and challenge that which should be impossible, the things that adventurers do every day, these inexplicable, horrible enemies that threaten the very world and the very existence. And these nobodies come from nowhere and fight it, your branch on the great Tree of Life blooms and almost like an acorn falling from a tree--I don’t know plants, so I’m paraphrasing--It blooms anew and you become an extension of the root, so you are you, you are the person you were, but you are that person you are now.
>
> I’ve- It’s- I don’t know, I’ve had lovers, friends, I- I think I even had a wife and kids recently. It’s- that’s why this is important. That’s why it’s afraid of these people that refract, these people that can persevere through these horrors that would break lesser men and women because we are, all of us, something that it cannot defeat. I’ve heard it said that our efforts are to stall what’s coming, but really, when it gazes upon us, that’s what it thinks its own efforts are- are to stall, but we are different. We have already won before, and we will do it again. If not us, others.<br>
**Erin**: Bruh. That’s really inspiring, but- Okay, if one of your refractions is The Seven then how come you’re not up here telling everyone what to do?<br>
**Seren**: How do we even know if we are refracted or not?<br>
**Braktor**: Uh, a lady, the Queen of the Shadowfell told me. I think she was- I think she’s married to a Seven.<br>
**Ozzie**: I think you’re just weird. Like, none of us are like, split up or nothin’, whatever you’re talkin’ about.<br>
**Braktor**: Well that’s the thing. I didn’t know. You don’t know until someone tells you. It shows you. Someone that understands that these worlds are cycles. They are stories that repeat and the only way these things change are through the courage you have within yourself to persevere and despite failing getting up and doing it again. Trying something new, growing. That’s how you refract. You see something that is impossible and you say, "Damn you, I will do it!" Also, I’m not up here explaining this because, well, quite frankly, I don’t know your- I don’t know your story and I don’t know what you’ve been through. You clearly understand what you’re talking about, but I too have seen things-<br>
**Erin**: Well that’s what I’m saying is, what have you been through, that you’re aware of your refractions?<br>
**Braktor**: Like I said, uh, the Queen of the Shadowfell awokened me. She has some kind of connection. I think she’s- I think she’s married to one of the uh, one of The Seven, one of the big ones.<br>
**Erin**: Yeah. Yeah, I know that.<br>
**Braktor**: She warned me that she and our, uh, our Scarab Lords- if I talk about the experiences that I’ve been through, if I explain my adventures, if I fully elaborate on the things that I know, The Herald, it too gains these memories, it knows these fights. It’s empowered, as you’ve said, by the more people know, so the more I explain what it’s capable of, the wells of knowledge that we could use to fight it, it will just be ready for us and it will prepare defenses.<br>
In a weird way, our only hope is to follow these strands of fate, follow the one thing that it cannot comprehend, the one thing that it does not have, which is our mortal ingenuity, our mortal creativity, our willingness to gamble-<br>
**Erin**: Cut to the chase, bruh. Do you remember breaking the covenant?<br>
**Braktor**: I broke a covenant, but I don’t think it’s the one that It broke. I could explain, but it’s uh, it’s a risk.<br>
**Erin**: Its… well, maybe not in this crowd, but it’s kinda important, don’t you think?<br>
**Braktor**: One of… in one of my lives I spoke to Inu, uh, the Master of the Shattered Gate and he explained to me that The Seven, to have any hope of winning, had to break the covenant of death and sever themselves from the Tree of Life. They had to die so that they would not.

> **Arcadum**: Hold please.<br>
***Arcadum** points to Morc<br>
**Arcadum**: Con save.<br>
**Russ (Morc)**: Oh, you motherfucker.

(Rolls `21(18)`)

> **Arcadum**: Your heartbeat quickens.

(Morc gasps for breath and his party gathers protectively)

> **Ives**: You good?<br>
**Seren**: You good? Do you need anything?<br>
**Morc**: Hearing those words. They caused a reaction.<br>
**Ives**: Okay, maybe we should shelve the uh-<br>
**Seren**: No more of that shit right now. No.<br>
***Seren** stares at Braktor<br>
**Antonius**: Wait. You said yourself more knowledge makes Him stronger, and this is clearly directly effecting Morc right now. This should not be something everybody is being told right now.<br>
**Morc**: I- I am going to become like the Translator.<br>
**Braktor**: Okay, look, and that is why I’m not at the podium. You’re clearly much more careful than I am. (referring to Erin)<br>

> **Arcadum**: As you say that, Braktor, you know it is not true, for there was always one bridge between The Seven and the people. There was always a mouth piece, one who could speak, that had the knowledge, but not the the power, who could speak more safely than those that sacrificed themselves. For the Seven will always need the Cardinal. Your words carry with you the power that we both know that they have.

(The conversation devolves to jokes about disembodied voices and about Ahst who has been standing there looking like Gruff this entire time.)
