(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/hdOyl5fVrDo?t=5353))

Whilst the party explores the Hall of Mirrors:

> **Arcadum**: As you enter the room you see what've at one point would have been a musicianâ€™s workshop. Violins, violas, katars--all sorts of instruments line the various workshop tables. Notes of music cover the shelves and walls, and all around you there is a sense of uplifting hope. This room is certainly not like the others; there is no uncertainty here.<br>
**Arcadum**: (to Clyde) Do you enter?<br>
**Clyde**: Yes.<br>
Arcadum: Alright, go ahead.<br>
***Clyde** enters.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you enter this room you begin to see shadows--grey, formless save for that they represent the people that have walked before you. The heroes of the past, of the other eras of Verum, and, specifically, they represent the shadows of The Seven. And within them, there is one such instrument that glows with their light, and that is this:<br>
***Arcadum** points to a violin sitting on a table in the back of the room.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you approach the instrument, you feel a shadow standing next to you. You see the formless image of a handsome man wielding a deck of cards. He flips them in his hand effortlessly and shuffles the deck with one as he places his fingers upon the strings of the violin in front of you. The shadow then places its hand upon your shoulder, Clyde, and a deep sense of hope flows into you, and just as quickly as it was there, the shadow is gone. And all around you, the same feeling fills the rest of you. Above you, on the ceiling, there is a painted mural of the seven-pointed star parting the dark clouds of uncertainty. This is a hallowed place, a blessed place, a place where adventurers walk untethered. And so, you have a choice: you can rest here, under complete safety at any time. But, there is power here that you may choose to use. You may call out to The Seven to grant you their aid, or you may choose to walk your trials alone. Both will have benefits, unknown and unseen.
>
> (to the party) What would you like to do?

(The party debates the decision, but ultimately calls out to the Seven)

> **Arcadum**: Call out to them? Very well.
>
> As you call out to them, at first there is a silence before all around you the shadows begin to shift, and you start to hear small, whispered voices.<br>
***Clyde** attempts to perceive what the voices are saying<br>
**Arcadum**: The voices are indecipherable, and it seems to be that they are either discussing something or chanting something.<br>
***Clyde** kneels down and begins to pray.<br>
**Arcadum**: Eventually, one of the shadows steps forwards to stand at your side, and with that, a single voice is raised amongst the rest. And although you cannot understand it, it is like a song, humming through your very being. The person that stands before you is a cleric of an unknown deity, his features etched away. He places his hand upon your form, Clyde, and as you are a follower of The Seven, he shall grant you a greater boon. You have a choice. You may choose to shoulder your burdens and reject his help. To do so you will earn a greater respect. Or you may choose to call out to his aid, and all that has troubled you will fade away.<br>
**Clyde**: I will shoulder the burden.<br>
**Arcadum**: Very well.
>
> You have chosen to shoulder your burdens, to face the trials of The Seven, of those that came before you, and to stand upon your own two feet. And as you make this decision, the power begins to become muted until the voices fade and there is naught but a single deep nearly-overwhelming silence.
