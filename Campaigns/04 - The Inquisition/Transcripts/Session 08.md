(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/Zw3MrFHxy5k?t=9980))

> **Arcadum**: As you walk closer to the old ruins, Zachariah, you begin to see shimmers of light, depicting the building once was and not what it has become.<br>
***Zachariah** walks to the altar<br>
**Arcadum**: As you enter the old cathedral you see that much of it has fallen into shambles but one thing has not. A beautiful stained glass window still etched into the old stone depicting the seven-pointed star. And through its shining light it glows on the altar in front of you. The altar shimmers with even more light as you approach. And on this altar there are several things.<br>
The first, is a candelabra with seven placements for candles. You see an old symbol of the Seven. Older than... who knows how old it could be and made of silver and time seems to not have touched it. And finally there is a third piece. You see a strange shard of crystal that glows with a violet light.

(*Investigates crystal shard*)

> **Arcadum**: As you investigate the crystal and look closely at it, the violet light begins to edd and flow. And within it you see a shadowy light begin to appear. And within this light but yet not light you can sense, not a full memory, but the presence of emotion. The presence of a life once lived within this vessel of crystal. It begins to flow with strength and power as you hold it. You feel a connection to it. You feel as if you might summon the strength within.
>
> And your choice is very simple:<br>
With such strength you could empower not only yourself, but the faith you have in the purpose you have made for yourself. The Inquisition has long been a backlog of Ordean culture. Only called upon in the most dire of circumstances. Even now, when there is trouble brewing on the horizon they refuse to give you your enstatement. But with this power you feel it call to you. A warmth. A presence. You feel the Seven and you believe that you can call upon them. And if you do so, your lifelong dream will not become the shamble, the shadow, of what you wanted it to be, but truly instated in all of its glory.
>
> Your choice is very simple:<br>
You may consume it to officially start the Inquisition as a faction with all the things that come with that. Or you may choose to return its power to this cathedral. Or you may choose to expend it for personal gain.
>
> I should point that none of these forms are considered evil or lawful or good or any of that. It is simply power to use as you wish. You will not be punished for any choice you make in terms of alignment, but your viewpoint may shift. But that is up to you. Three choices.

(*A Prayer to the Seven for Guidance*)

> **Arcadum**: As you speak to the Seven they begin to whisper. Shadows reflect through the light. Unseen, yet seen. They even appear outside the cathedral in front of Simon and Deximus. They appear in all shapes and sizes. All walks. All occupations. They stand as a shadowed crowd. They do not speak, but they offer their presence. And by studying them you can see that the Seven walked many of the paths. All of the paths. None of the paths. You asked them for guidance, but as the Seven were once mortal so it must be, a mortals decision.<br>
***Zachariah** chooses to reinstate the Inquisition<br>
**Arcadum**: You have made your decision. The crystal senses your intent and begins to rise above you. Then in a single burst of light, shatters. It flows into the sky and all around you. The light flows and your destiny as a warlock, as a servant to the Seven, is finally made manifest. And as you have made this decision the light swirls out in a pulse, so that all right now of your strength, your conviction, and of course your commitment. Your faith has been tested and you have been found... worthy.
