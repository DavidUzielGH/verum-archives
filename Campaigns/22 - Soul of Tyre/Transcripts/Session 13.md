## Relevant Lore

### Staff Ano Found

> **Arcadum**: The staff appears to have had two pieces of it torn free, which were given to you by Ano, and across it there is the symbol of the Green Triangle.

Oblivion shards are placed in lead-lined containers before dumped into the Tootbox.

30 Arcana on staff from Hackne:
> **Arcadum**: This staff appears to be a beacon of some kind, it's not so much a magical weapon, or even as a staff as it is, but more so some kind of communication device. As it is planted in the ground it is sending out a magical signal that is no doubt being read at this point.

34 History on staff from Hackne:
> **Arcadum**: The mysterious symbol of the Green Triangle yet still eludes you, you know that it is a divination based item. It appears to not be a two-way communicator, it appears to be only a detection sort of device, detecting for certain presence, although you don't know what the presence is. However, there is one other thing that you notice, there is something written along the edge of the staff, written in a language Bellanovan recognizes but cannot read. It is written in Cyclopean.

### Obituary Towers

Ster asking about how groups can visit Obituary Towers:
> **Arcadum**: Such a thing is available, well I should say, could be available, depending on bravado I suppose. But, there is something else that has to be resolved first. Ster, you told me at some point during the downtime that Guy would finally attune to the Songblade, and I can think of no other time that is better than now.

### The Third Songblade

Bellanovan, Ahst, Mirage, & Braktor begin some ceremony relating to the Life Stream in an attempt to find the "mysterous" third Songblade wielder.

> **Arcadum**: A spiraling helix of life will rise from the gathering, until finally, Inu joins. Moving its hands along with the rhythm, swirling, the helix grows in strength, and swirls back into the lifestream. Eventually the stream holds, and the dance is no longer required, and Inu will say...<br>
**Inu**: Finally, that which was lost can be restored.<br>
The frayed edges of the lifestream, the broken, errant, pieces can now be collected again, and returned to their rightful place. Wielder of Finale, apologies for your confusion, but there is a great purpose that yet lays before you, and against a great enemy.<br>
**Guy**: I don't even know what a lifestream is.<br>
**Inu**: Very well, then I shall tell you.<br>
**Inu**: The lifestream is all around us, swirling within and without. It is the beating of the heart, it is the call of a voice. It is the scent of a flower, the warmth of a hand, it is all of these things. Even one such as you, whose heart has ceased to beat, yet still thrums with life. Stuck between two worlds you might be, still yet, you live.<br>
**Guy**: You just want me to keep doing what I've been doing, or is there an objective?<br>
**Inu**: Yes, there is.<br>

> **Inu**: Indeed, you are correct, the trial of the Prism can now be completed. For that which was none is now three, and with it, the Prism may yet refract what we need.

> **Guy**: Do I need to tell my group to change course?<br>
**Inu**: Keep to your original purpose, do not stray from your path, for now you walk two paths at once. You bear the strength of a guardian, but your purpose, I feel, with the one before, is also as important.

> **Inu**: Guardians, now that you have finally found one another, and your dance can be completed, now I can show you the path. Now you may face the trial of the Prism, and now, perhaps, we may yet find a way... Yes.<br>
**Bellanovan**: You said find the way, the way to what?<br>
**Inu**: The way to your Nirvana. To your mastery.<br>
**Inu**: But there is yet something else. The Petulant Lords, I can feel them move, and one of you bears a meeting with them.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What are the Petulant Lords?
**Arcadum**: Ster, Petulant Lords... you met one of them.<br>
**Guy**: Bronchial? He did mention some Petulant Lords, but I admit I don't fully understand it either.<br>
**Inu**: Bronchial... Yes. One of the three, the Petulant Lords, the Lords of Decay, The Rotted and The Faded.<br>
**Guy**: Yes, we encouraged him to infest all of Quierg, and then we left.<br>
**Inu**: Was he...<br>
**Guy**: Happy? He seemed alright, he said that Tyre (he meant Tane) had put him there for that purpose. You see the whole council, everyone in Quierg was all corrupt, so we figured it'd be better if he just swallowed it whole.<br>
**Braktor**: Does this have anything to do with the staff with the Green Triangle that landed in our camp?<br>
**Inu**: What staff?<br>
**Braktor**: When we were fighting the you-know-what, one of our allies went to go investigate a mysterious light, and there was a staff with a green triangle.<br>
**Inu**: I see. Then that would mean one of the lords has found you, one of the lords has somehow sent you this message. Did it bear anything?<br>
**Party**: It had Cyclopean on it, and shards of the you-know power.<br>
**Inu**: Indeed. It seems that they have not been idle. Very well, then we are nearly complete. With the three songblades the path... the path might open. Petulant Lords may yet finally have their rest. But we are not quite there, for the path to the Vega can only be opened by three mirrors, and I see only two within the camp.<br>
**Braktor**: Any idea where we can get the jump on finding the other one?<br>
**Inu**: I have felt undulations that, perhaps, such a mirror can be found in the south. Far to the south of the position in the waking realm, in a place known as Dolten.<br>
**Braktor**: I can go looking for them.<br>
**Inu**: Yes, if you can do this, and gather the third piece of the mirror, then we will have the means to open, the key to open, and the authority to enter.<br>
**Inu**: Yes, and then the way to the Trigram Isles will be open at last.<br>
**Guy**: One last question, is this all related to fixing time?<br>
***Inu** will nod, and then will place a finger upon Guys head, filling him with all the knowledge of the story thus far saving (can't hear, Ster retching IC.)

(Discussion about what SC had been up to)

> **Arcadum**: You have the Trial of the Prism you can take, and you take that as the three songblades. Guy now understands everything that he needs to understand for the burden of that knowledge to be caught up to it, specifically the importance of Inu, the importance of everything that needs to be done would be the best way to put it.

> **Ster (Guy/Gruff)**: The Songblade is the Soul of Tyre, which I would have to explain to you guys whatever the fuck that means.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: Did you say the songblade was the Soul of Tyre? I thought you guys had the Soul of Tyre?<br>
**Ster (Guy/Gruff)**: This is it.<br>

---

> **Braktor**: Why is it a songblade?<br>
**Guy**: So one of my refraction used to have it, it’s some weird long story, I don’t know why Tyre had it though, long story short.<br>
So what do I do with it? You guys seem to be the whole Tyre people.<br>
**Braktor**: We sort of need it to unlock a door? I don’t know, we haven’t been to the labyrinth, we’ve sort of been just fucking around.<br>
**Arcadum**: Inu will not like hearing that you’ve been fucking around.

---

> **Ster (Guy/Gruff)**: So, hold on, now I’m confused. The Strangers sword was a shard of green light, that was the main part of it. But it is the red songblade?<br>
**Arcadum**: I think you may have taken that as a literal thing. The songblade is not itself one of the pieces of Tyre. The Strangers blade was, though. But the reason though, I see where your confusion is.<br>
**Ster (Guy/Gruff)**: The sword was like a giant stone sword, then it fell apart, and inside was the songblade.<br>
**Arcadum**: So, the Strangers Blade was the songblade that was one of the Songblades hidden away until the time came when it would be called upon again. The energy that hid it was Tyre, and that’s the piece.<br>
**Ster (Guy/Gruff)**: Am I right to assume that the Green Triangle is Tyre related?<br>
**Arcadum**: I can't answer that specifically. What has been revealed about the Green Triangle seems to be in reference to the Trigram Isles, and that the petulant lords are somehow involved.

---

> **Guy**: Inu, before you freak out anymore, what was the significance of three of us showing up with Songblades? If the way I'm understanding things, the Songblades must have somehow been connected to the Seven, shouldn't there have been more of them, like four more?<br>
**Inu**: There are other servants of the Prism that move their own strings and threads. The Weavers will do what they can to keep safe the Lifestream, that is the most I can answer.<br>
**Guy**: But you've alluded to us being complete, isn't that misleading? Or is this as good as it's going to get?<br>
**Inu**: Three Guardians have been complete. The key, if you will. But now passage must be made so that the key may be placed, and the path opened. You must return to that one place, to that one place in the waking realm where the Enemy cannot see you.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Which place is that?<br>
**Inu**: The Trigram Isles.<br>
**Bellanovan**: I see.<br>

> **Guy**: You guys knew a man named Tane?<br>
**Braktor**: I did. I think he gave our friends Eustace his arms.<br>
**Guy**: I don't believe we were sure, but it sounded like Bronchial implied that he was Tyre?

> **Inu**: Listen well to me, Guardians. Now that you are complete, the Enemy will be moving, it will be seeking to strike out. It can feel the strength of its enemy grow, and we must be ready. Take what time you can to spend with your comrades, but you must be ready. You must take the Trial of the Prism, just as others themselves are seeking to complete their trials.

---

> **Arcadum**: As you begin the dance to return back to camp, and begin to fade from Inu's realm.

(Camera will focus the galaxy map on the planet Maltos, and the party is told not to click on it.)

> **Arcadum**: As you attempt to return to the waking realm, you are instead pulled to here. You float through the Astral Sea, above the shaped remains of the shattered planet of Maltos, and you feel it behind you, you turn slowly and see the rising power of the Herald's light.
>
> You can feel the astral energies being pulled away from you, almost as if your attempt to return to the waking realm, by happenstance, was grabbed and twisted by this errant presence. The Violet light of the Herald grows brighter, as it grows closer to Kalkatesh.
>
> Right now you feel the power being drained out of you. Violet tendrils whip out from the Herald, what do you do?

Mirage sings and Braktor Weaves. Bellanovan crip walks.

> **Arcadum**: The three Songblades begin their dance, the Chord lends her voice, and the Weaver weaves the strands of life. The party begins to pull away, resisting, at least somewhat, the grasp of the Herald. But you will see as you retreat back to Kalkatesh, the Herald turns, shifting its weight, so to speak, and then begins to make its approach.
>
> And thus you return to the waking realm, with only the knowledge of your great purpose, the Trial of the Prism, and of course, the Herald growing ever closer.

> **Bellanovan**: Did I notice anything about that destroyed planet?<br>
**Arcadum**: Make me a perception check. (Bellanovan rolls a `25(19)`)<br>
**Arcadum**: You did. You notice a few symbols floating from some of the pieces blown up in these large, grand sort of, symbols, and statues, and adornments. You think you recognize the Taladoni symbols.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Where have I noticed the Taladoni symbols before?<br>
**Arcadum**: In the study of Power Words.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Can I recognize any of the symbols from when I was in the Red Star, cause there were some we couldn't read.<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah, some of them. Essentially what I'm getting at is that Maltos, in character, is connected to the Taladoni.

### Return to Camp

> **Braktor**: That place that we saw is one of the first places to harness this cursed power, and it destroyed them. But some of their legacy is still here, amongst the Taladoni in the city of Eassemere.


Braktor and Hackne's wedding happens, ministered by Azolon's Vizier. The group then considers their options for visiting the Violet Vault. Knowing it is connected to the Dream Realm due to Guy's knowledge they ask Mirage to pray to Wode to give them assistance in getting there.

Initially resistent to even responding to Mirage, they eventually convince him that they are both aware of the Vault and desire to go there. Wode opens a portal for them in camp and the group heads in, Guy & Mirage included.

End of session.
