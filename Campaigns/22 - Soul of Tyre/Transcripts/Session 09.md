### Moe & Dork

> ***Creature** gurgling noises, gestures friendly to you.<br>
**Moe**: "Hello?"<br>
***Creature** makes more noises<br>
**Moe**: My name is Moe, do you happen to speak any of the following languages...<br>
***Creature** makes more noises<br>
**Creature**: Moe? Oh Moe?<br>
***Creature** holds up tentacle.<br>

> **Criken (Moe)**: Moe will wait to see what he does with the tentacle if it stays there he will .. shake it.

> ***Creature** starts melting into the ground.<br>
**Creature**: There we go! Can you understand me now?<br>
**Moe**: Yes I can now.<br>
**Creature**: Oh good, it's been a while since I recalibrated, my name is Dork.<br>
**Moe**: Bork?<br>
**Dork**: Dork.<br>
**Moe**: Dork! Nice to meet you Dork. My name is Moe.<br>
**Dork**: Hello, welcome to my shop!<br>

**Criken (Moe)**: Moe will take a look, how does it look?<br>
**Arcadum**: It looks pretty good!

> **Moe**: It looks pretty good!

> **Arcadum**: You notice he sells things in tall glass orbs.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: It totally is!<br>
**Arcadum**: It totally is what?<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: It totally is the shopkeeper from Risk of Rain 2.<br>
**Arcadum**: okay<br>

> **Moe**: This place is great!<br>
**Dork**: (*noises*) Can I assist you with anything here?<br>
**Moe**: Uh, I suppose I was kinda just passing through space and I kinda show up here.<br>
**Dork**: I can understand you are a bit lost on the issue. Yes, so you are astral projecting and I am a special merchant this is my shop and I sell to travelers traveling the Astral Sea. So, you're my first customer in some time however.<br>
**Moe**: How long has it been?<br>
**Dork**: I'm not really sure... (*noises*) The last time I had an actual customer who did not try to steal from me was... the last planar war in the central nebula.<br>
**Moe**: The last planar war in the central nebula? Look I don't know what any of those words mean except war and planar to some extent. What would you recommend for a magic space cow hurtling through time to save his friends?<br>
**Dork**: Well you see my friend, I am a merchant of moments!<br>
Yes, moments in time collected my many adventurers and customers like you!<br>
**Moe**: Well isn't that hilarious, I am Moe, and you sell Moements! Haha!<br>
***Dork** laughs<br>
**Moe**: Anyways, I would like to peruse or shop but I am not sure what currency or tender you accept.<br>
**Dork**: Pfft, don't worry friend, everyone has something to pay me. You see I take trades. A moment for a moment.

> **Criken (Moe)**: He takes time? Does he take time or moments off my life?<br>
**Arcadum**: What a good question, why don't you ask him?

> **Moe**: Would those be memories I've had, what are to come, or years off my life?<br>
**Dork**: Allow me to explain...

> **Arcadum**: Dork takes out a STAR MAP then he will take a Map of the TAPESTRY OF FATE and put it over it. He will hammer it in place with a nail. He will gesture towards it.

> **Dork**: What I sell, and what I take for trade, my friend, is Paths upon the Tapestry. You see, my friend, basically, I trade moments that have not happened but can be traded for to happen.<br>
**Moe**: I see... do you have an example per chance?<br>
**Dork**: Very well friend, I will show you. You see There is a tapestry thread where we do not meet I will take that now.<br>
***Dork** spits it out (the tapestry thread) into his hand.<br>
**Dork**: You see? This is the moment that you did not meet me.. would you like to see what happened to you?<br>
**Moe**: Sure I will take a look.

> **Arcadum**: He will show you a alternate destiny in which you did not meet the merchant: Moe is traveling along before being split apart into a thousand pieces by a meteorite storm.

> **Moe**: I am sure glad I met you! Dork will look down.<br>
**Dork**: Oh, oh my goodness you probably don't want that.<br>
***Dork** will throw it out the window.<br>
**Moe**: I would not like to trade for that one.<br>
**Dork**: Which one would you like to trade for?<br>
**Moe**: Well what do you have?<br>

> **Arcadum**: Allrrigghtty then, let me explain to you, Criken, the best way I can. You have the ability to make a story choice ahead of time but in exchange you have to trade a story choice from ever appearing.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Mhm... huh.. so it's all future based..<br>
**Arcadum**: Correct, moments that have yet to happen.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: What does he value in the future?<br>
**Arcadum**: It's based on how much you get for it.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: So I pick one loss in order to gain in another area.<br>
**Arcadum**: That is correct.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: And how do we equate those?<br>
**Arcadum**: I do.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Do you have an example?<br>
**Arcadum**: Well one example would be where your party (Soul of Tyre) is not executed by the Shar'kai.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Sounds pretty good... I assume you can't go maximum level like, "We win the war."<br>
**Arcadum**: You could, but you would have to trade something of equal value what do you have to trade in equal value to that?<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: All of me (Moe).<br>
**Arcadum**: Not good enough champ.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I thought I was more important.. let me think.<br>
I think I could reason with the Shar'kai to let the current party go. I'm having trouble coming up with the negative options to exchange.<br>
**Arcadum**: Generally you tell me what you want, and I determine the cost.<br>
Also, I should point out but you can NOT pick a destiny in which you are not involved in anyway. For example, you can not choose for Shattered Crowns because you are not related to them.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Okay, let's start with the party down there not getting executed by the Shar'kai... and my wife doesn't hate me.<br>
**Arcadum**: You want BOTH of those?<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Let's just start with the first one, you're not a miracle worker.<br>
**Arcadum**: If you want the specific outlook where the party does NOT get executed the cost of that would be...
>
> The next venture into the Labyrinth for the Shadow of Tyre (Moe's party)... the next person to do a clash WILL fail.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: That's anyone in the party?<br>
**Arcadum**: Correct.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: What about something big like we secure the traitor's blade.<br>
**Arcadum**: Now we're getting spicy. IF you choose the path where you claim the traitor's blade then none of you, none of you.... wait that isn't good enough...
>
> If you choose this that the Traitor's blade is secured, then the Trigram isles are lost.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I don't know what that is do I?<br>
**Arcadum**: That's where the Vega are from... amongst other things.<br>
**Arcadum**: To be clear, any prophecy that includes the violet is not guaranteed.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: That's enough for Moe to not make that deal... How about securing the alliance of Odin and his pantheon?<br>
**Arcadum**: Okay...<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I love how this guy is a monkey's paw vendor that will tell you what happens, it's interesting.<br>
**Arcadum**: Very well, if you wish to secure the alliance of Odin, the cost of that will be you and your compatriots (Shadow of Tyre) will never be allowed to enter the Dream Realm.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I can't do that to Eustace... these are all selfish I don't want to do them. For the first option, every clash we had had degrees of failure. Do I know to which degree they will fail?<br>
**Arcadum**: Only that they will fail.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Okay, I'll do that.. to save another group.. man I don't like any of the options.. what about something dumb like I get a castle?<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, you receive a castle but lose respect of your wife.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: I'll keep that (the respect).<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: On the plus side that means she already respects you.<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: Yay.. I'm going to go with saving Soul of Tyre.<br>
**Arcadum**: So be it.<br>
**Ster (Gruff)**: Can you repeat it?<br>
**Criken (Moe)**: The positive is I save any of you from dying down there and the negative is my group will fail a clash in the labyrinth.

> **Dork**: That is quite the trade! Here you are my friend!
***Dork** offers the glass orb.<br>

> **Criken (Moe)**: What's inside?<br>
**Arcadum**: The fate you wished for.

> **Moe**: What do I do with it?<br>
**Dork**: Simply take it.<br>
**Moe**: Can I see what would have happened if I didn't take it?<br>
***Dork** laughs<br>
**Moe**: Is that a no?<br>
**Dork**: You have already picked it.<br>
**Moe**: I suppose so. It was nice meeting you, Dork.<br>
**Dork**: You as well.. (*laughs*)

> **Arcadum**: Moe returns to his body, for better or worse. And fate has been shifted.<br>
Oh one more thing, you should probably be aware of. A tattoo will appear on Moe, specifically on his left hand. It is marked with an hourglass shattering, marking you as an enemy of Raquel, the goddess of time.<br>
> **Criken (Moe)**: I didn't know that!<br>
**Arcadum**: Correct, you didn't know and wouldn't think to ask. And the merchant (Dork) certainly isn't going to tell you.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: How could you do this to Criken? He saved us.<br>
**Arcadum**: And he did.

Moe returns to Verum.
