# Soul of Tyre -- Session 16

## Relevant Lore

A lot of discussion happens OOC with the group about what to do this session. *Eventually* they decide to go back into the Labyrinth as it is likely safer to be there than at the Speaker fight coming up. Given all the new information they have it could be considerably dangerous to be in the presence of such a strong enemy who may have ways of extracting that information.

Except, maybe, they could just *real quick* take a visit to the Violet platform within the Violet Vault.

### The Violet "Tower"

> **Arcadum**: The Violet energy here is different from what you've encountered before. Whereas the Violet before was foreboding and indicative of doom, this, while not less threatening, seems more unwielded. Like a great weapon left upon a shelf, waiting for a hand to reach out and grab it.
>
> You walk past the great monoliths and stand before the foundation. There is a large 7 pointed star swirling with violet fire.

(Perception check: Highest `18(14)` from Mirage)

> **Arcadum**: You see something very slight within its flames, almost like a face looking back. As you take a closer look, trying to see the images within, slowly you see more and more of them. Faces. Faces fill the fire. You see the face of a kindly looking gnome with goblin blood. You see the face of what appears to be a draconic sorcerer. You see the face of a fair haired fighter. Then further within it more and more faces can be seen. Until, finally, you see one you think you recognize. You think you see Eustace for but a moment, but then you realize that the skin is paler, you see someone else instead. A monk covered in tattoos and with a smiling face shifting through the fire and down. Then you see it, the fire begins to grow and the faces number in the thousands.

(Perception check from Braktor: `21`)

> **Arcadum**: Braktor, as you gaze within the fire you see more clearly than the others. You see instead the actions that have led to the sealing of their fate. You see your own refractions and every single creature that you have ever killed. You see their faces drifting in the fire.<br>
> **Uni**: It is a testament to Oblivion's strength. For that which was destroyed must go somewhere, here it joins the Violet. Its strength is ever growing, like fuel for flamed fire.<br>
**Hackne**: Are you saying the deaths of everyone and everything are fueling the Violet.<br>
**Uni**: That which the Violet takes, yes.<br>
**Belanovan**: Everything that gets Violet Deathed comes here because the Prism is broken, that's what we learned.<br>
**Ozzie**: Can we try to pull them out?<br>
**Uni**: Theoretically, if one had the will one could conjure them forward, but only one such entity has ever had the will to bend the Violet. Or at least to what it has become. It was to be one of my domains, but now it has become something far worse.<br>
Before I was usurped, ‘tis I that would be the warden of these souls. But now we are looking through glass, to what awaits on the other side. Close enough to see, but too far to reach.<br>
**Gruff**: I think I could fish out a few souls.<br>
**Braktor**: Please don't try it.

> **Andy (Falcon)**: I can try and pull them out myself. The only thing I'm scared of is it corrupting the lifestream.

> **Hackne**: All the colors combined make black.<br>
**Uni**: Yes, it does.<br>
**Hackne**: Is that indicative of anything?<br>
**Uni**: You are confused, this is light. When all light works in harmony it becomes clear. A clarity through which all the world might be seen, a filter for life to flow freely. Where there is no light, there is only me.<br>
**Gruff**: He's saying that there's too much Violet. So, if I should go fishing, I should go fishing in the Red to balance it all out.<br>
**Ozzie**: If we defeat the Violet will the souls be freed, or defeated along with it?<br>
**Uni**: Who can say. The very existence of this is a testament to wrongness; to imbalance. Ideally in the world where there is justice, once the balance has been reset, that which was stolen returns to where it belongs. But the world is not just.<br>
**Ozzie**: I know we're in a world of wispy-waspy nothingness, but could we physically destroy this tower? Could that be done or conducive of our goals?<br>
**Uni**: If even such a thing was possible -- it is doubtful -- for what is to come will happen in a new iteration. When the great wheel turns, if we are only able to delay its turning, then you will not be here, and therefore that which was destroyed will be undestroyed.<br>
**Hackne**: It will all be reset.<br>
**Uni**: Correct.<br>
**Ozzie**: Are all the souls that have existed in the first iteration simply reused between iterations? Like is it the same souls but in different bodies every time?<br>
**Uni**: The Lifestream is all shared. The life that enamours you is life that has enamoured another. Refracted souls are simply able to see the truth of themselves. However, as life grew, what was finite became infinite. But what was infinite became limited. ‘Tis an awful balance, ‘tis a terrible realization.<br>
**Gruff**: So, is this Violet not corrupted Violet? Is it different?<br>
**Uni**: I suppose if one were to classify it, it would be indifferent, yes.<br>
**Gruff**: I change my mind, I want to fish this Violet.<br>
**Mirage**: Do you think we could go to the other towers and summon others?<br>
**Uni**: Other what?<br>
**Mirage**: Others like Falcon.<br>
**Uni**: They must be found at the waking realm like he was, but yes. If they are awoken they shall be granted their domains and their colors return to their place in the Prism.<br>
**Hackne**: We read the scrolls, we know the information, do we still need to protect them? Will something bad happen if we have them?<br>
**Uni**: Yes, for it is knowledge. As the wheel resets, everything does. That includes the Violet. The problem is that it remembers and it is more efficient every turning.<br>
**Ozzie**: How do we make it forget?<br>
**Uni**: I don't know. It should not remember, yet it does. This is one of the many reasons that it is wrong. With each resetting we grow weaker, the resources of those that would resist it expend themselves and are forced to forget. But, the Violet remembers and it is faster, and stronger, and more efficient with each iteration.

### Gruff Goes Fishing

Gruff will fish the Violet flames, aiming for no soul in particular. Arcadum asks for a long moment.

> **Arcadum**: There have been a total of 649 characters that the Violet has taken. Depending on which I roll, or the area I roll, will determine whether or not Gruff survives Violet Death.

Asking for clarification if these are all Player Characters or not:
> **Arcadum**: These are player characters, or specific characters that I have made for this particular interaction.
>
> I'm gonna roll a random [d649]. This will determine the soul which Gruff’s rod hooks. If it is a 1-67, Falcon, you can intervene. If it is 124-200, 378-400, 550-572, there's a chance of survival. 640 is Tane.

Gruff, with the birthday 20 from Surefour and his fishing proficencies, lands a `37` fishing, granting him, effectively, advantage on the [d649] roll.

First roll is `242`, death.<br>
Second roll is `175`, chance of survival.

Arcadum asks Gruff for a constitution saving throw as the Violet flames lick up the fishing pole towards him.

Constitution saving throw is `12` on first roll.

Asking if there is *anything* else Gruff/Ster has he allows him a class trait that lets him reroll a save while raging.

Second roll: `25(19+6)`.

His fishing rod is destroyed, avoiding Violet Death. However, the force of his pull brings something to the front. They find a dragon soul.

> **Arcadum**: A dragon’s soul is brought to the forefront and almost seems to awaken a little. The creature begins to speak, but no words are heard except:
>
> Falcon, as you are here you hear its voice. You hear it like listening through a pane of glass, just on the other side, muted, fuzzy, almost as if it is being played over notes of a melody. And then, it speaks clearly within your mind, and then fades back into the fire.

(Arcadum DM's Andy some information as it is for his ears only)

> **Falcon**: I think I may know where the Traitor's Blade is.<br>
**Braktor**: What did you find out? Assuming it's safe to say.<br>
**Falcon**: Where did you say the blade is supposed to be? Or where you think it's supposed to be?<br>
**Belanovan**: Sickened Sea. And we were able to ask 3 secrets from the scrolls, surrounded by some sort of barrier where you need to know a very special song to get through it. Not even The Herald's servants can get to it right now.<br>
**Falcon**: Alright. I guess I don't really have any new information then, if you already know that.<br>
**Braktor**: Do you know what the creature that was trying to talk to you looked like?<br>
**Falcon**: No, I don't.<br>
**Gruff**: Why'd it go right back to the place it doesn't want to be?<br>
**Falcon**: The Traitor's Blade is actually in the old city I used to be a part of, in the Sickened Sea.<br>
**Ozzie**: What's the name of the city?<br>
**Falcon**: Tyr's Drop.

> **Arcadum**: STOP!<br>
**Arcadum**: Andy, is Todd [Koga's player] home?<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: He is, I'm pretty sure.<br>
**Arcadum**: Is your brother home? Call him if you can.

### The Indigo Awakens

> **Arcadum**: Falcon Bladeweaver, as you enact the power word of Tyr's Drop- And because the Traitor's Blade is in the city deep beneath the waves of the Sickened Sea, as it has been for untold time. And so, technically, that is a sufficient amount of power-
>
> ...that's two colors. A union is spoken, the Green and the Violet. Both of them have said it, therefore, my friend and companion of all these long years, please choose one of your brothers and return them to the Prism. Choose another color.

(OOC discussion on what Arcadum means)

> **Andy (Falcon)**: That's easy, Orange.

> **Arcadum**: Orange light flows from the tower, lighting its flame, and a figure is seen at its base. Falcon, you sense your comrade, you sense your old friend and ancient rival.

Andy IMMEDIATELY changes his mind and instead chooses Indigo.

> **Arcadum**: Ladies and gentlemen, I have someone to introduce. Hail traveler, you there, Todd? You got art for Koga you want to use?

> **Arcadum**: Falcon you sense one of your comrades and now Green will no longer stand alone as it is joined by the Indigo.

The party heads over to the Indigo Tower.

> **Arcadum**: Falcon, you see an old friend. You see Koga the Thief: The First Shadow.

Falcon and Koga start talking. Koga and Falcon shake hands, expressing the 8437 years that have passed.

> **Koga**: Where have we been, what's going on, where's everybody else?<br>
**Falcon**: I've only been awake for a week or so now, the rest of us are still trapped.<br>
**Party**: Please introduce yourself.<br>
**Koga**: I am Koga.<br>
**Arcadum**: As Koga speaks his name the First Shadow walks the land again. Life no longer alone. Life has its shadow and thus a little bit more of the world is made right once more. Across the edge of oblivion, in the Indigo Scar, where heroes now fight to take on the mantle of Herald of the Indigo, the crystals glow, the light shines, and where there was once Despair a little more hope shines.

> **Arcadum**: Todd, are you available this upcoming monday at 9pm CST?<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: Yeah, that's when I thought this was gonna happen.<br>
**Arcadum**: Excellent, you need to be there.

> **Arcadum**: As your name is spoken, the Heroes of Kalkatesh are granted 10 Order.

> **Todd (Koga)**: Does my character understand the Prism?<br>
**Arcadum**: You don't quite understand what it is, but you do know at the fall of Tyr's Drop, before it sunk into the sea, there were Seven that stood against what was to come. And all that you remember is that there was a great light. And I believe you were the first of us to get- let me type it to you.
>
> You were the first of us to get that, and as such, that is what the Prism is made of.<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: Do I know what Orange is referring to?<br>
**Arcadum**: Orange is referring to one of the colors of the prism. Specifically the color of ambition and conquest. A color that you know well, that belongs to the warrior of the group, Scorter Firefist.
>
> You also know, burdened with terrible knowledge, that as the Traitor's light, the Violet light threatening to break the wheel, the other colors must be awoken if there is any hope at all. Good must fight with evil, law with chaos, creation must fight with oblivion. As the Shadow Walker you know this more than most, between the line between oblivion and nothing.

### Uni's Identity

As Koga is the first Shadow he recognizes Uni for who he is. He is Victor. Vic for short. Koga calls out to him:

> **Uni**: That name is familiar... I was once. I am not that anymore.<br>
**Arcadum**: Uni shifts between Uni and the red robed wizard, like a glitch, back and forth.<br>
**Koga**: How did you get here?<br>
**Uni**: All I remember was the fall.<br>
**Koga**: The fall of what?<br>
**Uni**: Tyr's Drop.<br>
**Koga**: A lot of things happened there, do you remember exactly what happened?<br>
**Arcadum**: You feel that pieces of his own memory begin to return, as two colors stand before him. He sees it, Tyr's Drop as it once was. The great city, the stoned jewel within the mountain. You see it reflected within him, then you see it fall away, and he returns to Uni.

More of the colors need to be awakened for him to return to his former self.

### Chatting With Koga

> **Ozzie**: Mr. Indigo, maybe you remember a bit better than Falcon here, there was a fella named Lorn in Tyr's Drop. Can you tell me anymore about him?<br>
**Koga**: That name is lost on me.<br>
**Ozzie**: If it's any difference to you, he has ascended to a god in this time. Lord of Decay. And I'm a servant of his. Next time I talk to him I'll ask him about you, see what he knows.<br>
**Koga**: That used to happen a lot back in my day.<br>
**Braktor**: Clearly the name of your city has power, so we should probably be careful. But, how did it get its name? Was it a person, or was it just a word?<br>
**Falcon**: We spelled it T-y-r. It was named after one of the gods of our time and it’s a pretty silly name. We liberated the city from this wizard that was mind controlling people that had a tattoo of a teardrop next to their left eye.<br>
**Koga**: The whole town was under their thrall.<br>

> **Sean (Braktor)**: Does that tattoo sound familiar?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep.<br>
**Sean**: Oh my fucking god. It's a fucking pun.

> **Braktor**: You were the first of The Seven and I'm much later on down the line. And now I find myself in the path of the Weaver protecting the Lifestream and it is damaged and broken. And I'd like to ask both of you if there's anything you can do to repair it or help me repair it. Life and Death are part of the same coin and you're both critical parts of- I'd appreciate any help you can provide. Though protecting our camp from the Enemy will have to come first.
>
> **Koga**: Death is another shadow.

> **Arcadum**: As your mind moves towards it, you can see where you were. You were trapped within a place known as the Indigo Scar, where you, like the others, made their last stand at Tyr's Drop. You were freed by the power of Falcon and the word of the past. But now, the ancient trial, based upon the remnants of your own strength, they battle now for the right to become your champion. You see them now in your minds eye. Their blood splatters across the crystals that forge your tomb and there a strange creature overwatches them all; a herald of a god that seeks that all things are fair.
>
> The world has changed in the years that you have slept, but one thing remains the same. The cost of strength is suffering, and they suffer within the scar.<br>
**Koga**: So there are people suffering for me somewhere?<br>
**Arcadum**: They're trying to complete this trial for the strength to face The Enemy, but they don't understand that the way this power is transferred is from you.

Todd asks if this transfer would weaken him in any way. It does not. Koga gets to name a champion.

> **Todd (Koga)**: They seem to not be doing very well?<br>
**Arcadum**: At this time there is Despair in their hearts.<br>
**Todd (Koga)**: That's something maybe we could do, help them out.<br>
**Arcadum**: That is up to you.

Koga resolves to go to the Scar, it's got his name on it after all.

> **Arcadum**: Whenever you are ready, you must simply walk through shadows to go where you wish to go.

> **Braktor**: Can all of you teleport? That's terribly convenient.<br>
**Falcon**: Maybe?<br>
**Koga**: I've always gotten to where I needed to get going.

Koga heads to the Indigo Scar.

### The Violet Sevenic Scrolls

Falcon says Koga's name and it summons him back. Hackne will give Koga the scrolls.

> **Arcadum**: As you grasp at the scroll you will see them for what they are. To them they look as if scrolls, forbidden knowledge written upon them. But you see old journal entries, lists of items and inventory, scrawling maps of another time. You see your old plans that you made with your comrades all those years ago.

> **Todd (Koga)**: So these are mine?<br>
**Arcadum**: More so your old groups.

> **Koga**: I've seen these before, strangely enough.<br>
***Koga** shows them to Falcon.<br>
**Falcon**: They look familiar.<br>
**Arcadum**: As the two of you take a look at the old notes, you're able to read through some of the scrolls and you believe you know what they are. These scrolls are the plans to build the Twilight Station.<br>
**Falcon**: Does it say where it was built?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep, in a secret place. In an attempt to build away from the others, these were the plans to build a home, a headquarters, a staging area.<br>
**Koga**: Do the plans say how to get to the Twilight Station?<br>
**Arcadum**: It doesn't say how to get there, but it says there is a coded entry that is written here. It is written in such a way that only the two of you can understand. Do you guys remember the candle?<br>
**Falcon**: The candle of truth?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah.<br>
**Falcon**: Kinda.<br>
**Arcadum**: Its light still illuminates the window sill of the Twilight Station. It yet still waits over the plans that once built it. If the candle was blown out then its defenses are open and you may enter.<br>
**Falcon**: So we just need to find that candle.<br>

### The Astral Traveller Notices

> **Braktor**: ...it was just sitting there.<br>
**Falcon**: Have any of you heard of the Candle of Truth?<br>
**Braktor**: Did it have a particular color to it?<br>
**Falcon**: I don't believe so.<br>
**Braktor**: I think I've seen it either way.<br>
**Falcon**: Are there dark elves in this world?<br>
**Hackne**: Yep.<br>
**Falcon**: Would you happen to know the names of any of them?<br>
**Braktor**: I would, and I think I know who you're talking about, but it's very dangerous to throw those names around. If there's anyone it's safe to tell to, it's probably you two.<br>
**Falcon**: Have any of you ever heard of the name Gordon Lightfoot?

> **Arcadum**: Is that the first time you've said it?<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Yes.<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright. As you state the name Gordon Lightfoot a couple things are going to be happening. A flame appears in Koga's hand, and then in Falcon's hand- a flame that represents the fire within, a representation of their color, and the two of you know of what you speak. The gift that we received. The terrible burden. It has reawakened and rekindled. Not just in you, but in the world.

> **Koga**: Does that mean he's alive?<br>
**Falcon**: I'm pretty sure we killed him.<br>
**Koga**: I don't remember if we did.<br>
**Falcon**: I think it was you and one of the paladins in our group that did it?<br>
**Koga**: I remember I asked for his help right at the end.<br>
**Braktor**: This dark elf, is he an emperor of some kind?<br>
**Koga**: A Drow.<br>
**Braktor**: Were there any other notable Drow family that you dealt with? Types? Names? That stuff.
>
> **Braktor**: You should be careful, he was a Traitor.<br>
**Falcon**: Emperor Twelvestar

> **Arcadum**: Nothing happens.

> **Braktor**: Do you remember the first name?<br>
**Falcon**: I don't.<br>
**Braktor**: I knew his son- that was a Twelvestar, that tried to stop all this before it could ever happen. I don't suppose you remember any V names? I'm just worried if I say it I'll die.<br>
***Braktor** will write down Ventil on the paper and give it to Koga.<br>
**Koga**: Ventil?<br>
**Arcadum**: There is a flash of power, across creation there at the Red Star, power cracks, and surges forward. Out through creation, the Astral Traveller turns her gaze toward the Vault.

> **Arcadum**: You know something happened, but you don't know what. That was purely cinematic.

> **Koga**: Technically I clashed with his uncle.<br>
**Braktor**: All I know is that he seemed to be a very good man.<br>
**Koga**: His uncle wasn't.

Party will spend 5 Order on the Orange Tower, then go to the Labyrinth, and that’s the end of the session.
