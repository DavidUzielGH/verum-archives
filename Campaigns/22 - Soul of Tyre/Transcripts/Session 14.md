# Soul of Tyre -- Session 14

Aired: 11/03/2020

Picking up where session 13 ended the group skips directly to the Violet Vault from camp.

## Relevant Lore

### Outside the Vault

The group sees a woman standing in front of the Vault door. We know this to be Amber Sky:
> **Arcadum**: Her silhouette seems to quiet all things, add peace to all things.<br>
**Amber**: (to Guy) It seems you've returned.<br>
**Guy**: Yes, long story. But I communed with my songblade and I'm getting thrown all over the universe right now.<br>
**Amber**: The Guardians are complete. The three are unsheathed. And the Myth has returned to its place in the North. It seems that the times are finally right and your souls bear with them many refractions. You may yet have the strength to seek what is on the other side.<br>
**Braktor**: Is it safe for me to be here?<br>
**Amber**: Of course it is, Seven, for this lingering power is yours. Left behind by every iteration of those that came before.<br>
**Braktor**: I just... I don't understand what we did wrong. I mean I think I do, I just...<br>
**Amber**: Wrong? What is it you think you've done wrong?<br>
**Braktor**: I killed a very good man.<br>
**Amber**: Yes, you did. And yet here you are. I am not one to devalue life, but we do not live in a world of naivety or front loaded commonplace philosophy. I will not quiet your mind with talk of the greater good, for it will not quiet it. But perhaps, the weight of your purpose may yet endure it. However, enough of that. The cosmic lines have finally been arranged. The lights are in their places and the gate can be opened. The Enemy has long since been gathering its strength.<br>
**Braktor**: Why didn't we just do all this last time? Why are we set up to fail?<br>
**Amber**: You did. All will be revealed, just as it was so many times before.<br>
**Braktor**: I can't do it wrong this time... I've got too much.<br>
**Amber**: You've had much more.<br>
**Braktor**: Not like this, every other time I knew it was a lie.<br>
**Amber**: Hold fast, for now the stars, the lights, the colors, all shine as one. And as the enemy has gathered its strength for so long, so too are the Seven prepared to stand with you all. Come along, the gate is ready to be opened.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What exactly even is this place?<br>
**Amber**: This is a place at the Edge of Creation. A place between Memory and Dream. Thought and action. Death and Mercy.<br>
**Bellanovan**: But why does it exist?<br>
**Amber**: It was made by the Seven. It was their... loophole, I suppose.<br>
**Braktor**: We put everything here at the end, just in case.<br>
**Amber**: Precisely. For each time the Seven faced against the Enemy they knew that perhaps they would fail. So, they left remnants of their strength behind. And each time this is repeated. And each time this place has grown.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Wait, they knew they would fail? So there's a chance we're fighting an unwinnable battle?<br>
**Braktor**: I wish I could say why we knew, but you all, the regular folk, you are the heroes inside this story.<br>
**Hackne**: Even if we don't win now, even if all this is an eventual battle we all have to keep fighting over and over again. If I can win this world a couple more years it'll be worth it.<br>
**Gruff**: Every time I succeed it's by accident. You take the wins when you can get them.<br>
**Braktor**: Is it safe to speak here?<br>
**Amber**: That decision is yours, Seven. But this is a place the Enemy does not see.<br>

> **Sean (Braktor)**: And you said this is a place we can refract, right?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes.

> ***Braktor** refracts into Jonah and introduces himself:
**Jonah**: Me and him, we share the same thoughts. We just wanted to let you know that we're working on things from the other side. Things are moving, people are awakening. Just do what you can. We're putting our pieces on the board. Just remember that whatever happens, pawns win chess.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Who's the King and the Queen?<br>
**Jonah**: We're working on your little fourth-man problem, you know what I mean Mr. King over here, and his friends.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What fourth man problem?<br>
**Jonah**: Your blade. We're working on that bit.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Oooh.<br>
***Jonah** refracts back into Braktor.<br>
**Hackne**: You said that this place can't be seen by... him. So, where is the Tootbox?<br>
**Braktor**: I have it.<br>
**Amber**: My name is Amber Sky, and as for your inclination to do what it is you wish to do, I think it's better you should do it on the other side.<br>
**Guy**: Have you ever been in there, Amber?<br>
**Amber**: Yes. Once.<br>

Some discussion about what Guy and Shattered Crowns did when they went in last time occurs and Guy insists they somehow changed the past and that's why Derok has his hammer back now.

> **Braktor**: You aren't changing the past, you're collecting the things we left behind. You know, specifically for this sort of day.<br>
**Guy**: Perhaps, I don't know this man but I hope he's doing alright with the things we sent him.<br>
**Braktor**: Well you'll meet him, they've been in there a while though.<br>
**Guy**: How are you a Seven and not dead?<br>
**Braktor**: The power of refraction, why i am what I am you'd have to understand things that would most certainly destroy you.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Are you saying you only exist because people believe in you?<br>
**Braktor**: I'm just a person, Bellanovan. Some people come into this world in one way, others come in another.<br>

Returning to the topic of the Violet Vault:
> **Amber**: Now that the Myth has been opened, the gate may open freely.<br>
**Braktor**: What's it going to let out?<br>
**Amber**: Once the gate opens knowledge returns to this world, on both sides.<br>
**Ozzie**: Knowledge is dangerous, I've heard this over and over and over.<br>
**Braktor**: That's what was so difficult about all this. How can you give them Hope when you don't have something to hold up other than your own words?<br>
**Amber**: You already have the key, now the door can be opened. Step forward and stand before it.<br>
**Braktor**: Can you give me a moment?<br>
**Braktor**: (to Amber) Can I ask you something? Were you here after or were you here before everything?<br>
**Amber**: I have been here since the first.<br>
**Braktor**: I'm so sorry for what happened. I don't think anyone came out of this not being a victim. And I know I'll do my duty but, I wish it could have been different.<br>
**Amber**: I know.<br>
**Braktor**: Time fades before us, oh great giants. We shall walk in terror(?) no more.

> **Arcadum**: Those of you that have refractions will do so now.<br>
**Arcadum**: As such, the many visages and silhouettes shift and split from the spectrum of light. And the gate that has been sealed is no longer sealed. The eye opens, and finally, I get to show you this.

### Gate of Oblivion - Beyond

> **Arcadum**: As you walk through the gate to the other side, what opens before you is an irradiant violet light. Whereas the Violet before has always been a sign of corruption and wrongness here it has not lost its potency, but it somehow feels as if it belongs. And there you stand, within the precipice of the Violet piece of the Prism and where the Traitor shattered the union.<br>
As the party finishes entering you can feel an overwhelming surge of strength pulse through you. All your refractions surge into all at once. And then, splitting off from you, a figure is formed. It appears to be a shadow, a silhouette of a person. But you know it for what it is to be. It is a Seven Shade.<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mTz5OXX.jpg" alt="Seven Shade Handout" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/mTz5OXX.jpg)<br>
Of the leftover vestiges of power coerced and manifested into singular will, it is a representation of the All. Everything, all into one.<br>
The Shade will give a deep bow of reverence to those that would cross the gate.

> **Braktor**: I'm just glad I'm not the last one.

> **Ster**: Has Guy seen one of these before?<br>
**Arcadum**: No.

> **Bellanovan**: Braktor what is that thing?<br>
**Braktor**: That's me, that's all of us. We're all the same. Well not you, I mean me and the others.<br>
**Bellanovan**: You're a shade?<br>
**Braktor**: We are not what these limited mirrors portray us, not entirely. For what it matters I am me. I am Braktor. I may be others but the Me you know is not a lie. I think and I feel and I love.<br>
**Hackne**: Braktor.<br>
**Braktor**: Yes?<br>
**Hackne**: We never worried about that for just a second, that's your existentialism talking.
**Braktor**: It's important you understand we made this for you, we always knew there'd be something after us but we didn't know what.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What happens if I touch it?<br>
**Braktor**: I can't say, but I believe you're safe here.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What if I put one of my life strands into it?<br>
**Braktor**: It's not... By all means, try. But it's not life as you think of it. It's a shadow that gives light from the Edge of all things. It's a creator, as it always should have been.<br>
**Bellanovan**: So it's a candle?<br>
**Braktor**: That's not an inappropriate metaphor.<br>

> **Arcadum**: (Ironic he would use that actual metaphor. Man that is poetic.)

> **Braktor**: It's like I said, I'm just a candle, just like all of us.<br>
**Bellanovan**: Does that mean we're the matches?<br>
**Braktor**: No, you're a candle. The things you do, the way you behave, the interactions you have. All the souls that walk here and watch beyond: you're the spark. It creates more shadows and lights more candles, and all things go in a great wheel.<br>
That's what Hope is, at least the way I see it. No matter what happens, and no matter what horrible terrible things you see. No matter how much you think you're gonna lose. You keep coming back, cause maybe you like it, but you’re stubborn. Or maybe you won't rest until you see the end of it.<br>
That’s Hope.<br>
**Ozzie**: Can you talk?<br>
**Arcadum**: The Shade will gesture behind it and begin to lead you.<br>
You see everything that's here, and you see it in the distance. And eventually you are led to a tower rising up from the Violet light, and on the Tower there is an Indigo Scar.<br>
**Bellanovan**: What's this thing? Why's it bringing us here?<br>
**Ozzie**: Is this an Obituary Tower?<br>
**Braktor**: In a sense. It's probably easier if the Shade explains.<br>
**Mirage**: Can it feel things?<br>
**Braktor**: I mean... It's just like light in a Prism. It only exists in the things it shines upon, and that's me, and that's well, others. Whether it itself can feel, um, I suppose that's a good question.<br>
**Bellanovan**: You told me this thing is like a light in a prism.<br>
**Braktor**: Yes, cause it's refracted.<br>
**Ozzie**: Can we keep it?<br>
**Braktor**: Probably not.

---

> **Arcadum**: As you stand with the shade in front of the first tower, the shade will not speak, but will instead show you what they represent.<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright. The Shade will unravel the memories that are locked within the Tower. Within it you will see it is filled to the brim with these strange crystals. These crystals are etched with the slightest color of Indigo and within them you see souls. Souls crystallized and stored.<br>
And now I can go out of character and explain what this place is.

> **Arcadum**: This place is a reflection of the Obituary Towers. Whereas the Obituary Towers  represent what was lost and mark the destruction of the universe, this place represents a reflection of what was saved from the iterations before. And thus, the Seven in all their strength lies before you as an open ledger of record.

#### The Towers

First Tower -- Indigo Scar:<br>
**Indigo**: Is the tower of Death and represents challenge and trial.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L56DmNe.jpg" alt="Indigo Scar Tower" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/L56DmNe.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: The first tower is the Indigo Scar because it represents when the betrayal occurred. When Violet was severed from the Prism, and its neighboring color was scarred by its escape.

Second Tower -- Blue Cross:<br>
**Blue**: Represents the Dream, and represents reflection and whimsy.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MxL57U8.jpg" alt="Blue Cross Tower" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/MxL57U8.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: The Blue Cross. Where the Gods and Goddesses and Deities of that time attempted to use all of their brute force to destroy the enemy upon his return. But their strength was used too brazenly, and those that followed them abandoned them in their time of need. Brute force could not destroy the Enemy, for it is clever and subtle. Like a slow poison before it is too late.

Third Tower -- Green Triangle:<br>
**Green**: Life, health, and abundance.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TYZFuMQ.jpg" alt="Green Triangle Tower" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/TYZFuMQ.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: This was an iteration in which as many places as possible were attempted to be awoken. All the strength that the world could offer, and cooperation became paramount. But they failed.

Fourth Tower -- Yellow Quadranox:<br>
**Yellow**: Represents Time, preparedness, and responsibility.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WAs0BZy.jpg" alt="Yellow Quadranox Tower" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/WAs0BZy.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: In this iteration the Enemy's sight and its prediction were the focus. Brave men and women sacrificed their lives to the forge to discover a way they might fight these false gods. And as such within the Quadrinox a material (amber) was discovered, and bound to seal the Enemy's sight.

Fifth Tower -- 5-Pointed Orange Star:<br>
**Orange**: Represents Ambition, avarice, and sacrifice.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hzDpVqI.jpg" alt="Orange Star Tower" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/hzDpVqI.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: Glows with an Orange light, its strength pulsing with Need and Ambition. It wishes for the fight, and it takes the fight directly to the Enemy in every aspect. On the battlefield, behind closed doors, courtyards, the knife, the spell it did not matter. Unfortunately, the Orange Tower did not suffice, for Ambition is a dangerous tool, and in some it granted different paths of interest.

Sixth Tower -- 6-Pointed Red Star:<br>
**Red**: Represents Wisdom, comradery, and teamwork.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NcrEwA0.jpg" alt="Red Star Tower Platform" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/NcrEwA0.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: This toweryYet remains to be fully constructed, and is comprised of the Six-pointed Red Star of Annareth. The Tower is not complete for this iteration is not yet complete. It is the Hope that Wisdom in this iteration will yet prevail.<br>
Alright, and as it is being forged, churning to life before you, the Shade turns your visage to a yet untouched tower. One that has not even begun.

Seventh Tower -- 7-Pointed Violet Star:<br>
**Violet**: Oblivion, and it is all seeing.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YqXKFBl.jpg" alt="Violet Star Tower Land" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/YqXKFBl.jpg)
> **Arcadum**: The tower of the Violet itself. The Shade explains that this iteration is the last in which the Enemy is not at full strength. The Shade reveals that this iteration is the last chance, the very last chance. For in the Seventh, the Shade reveals, with much fear and anxiety, that it is the seventh iteration that all of the Violet beckons to its master again. And that’s *everything*.

---

> **Arcadum**: The Shade finishes its tour, and it stands once more before the Indigo Tower.<br>
It will then reveal further, that this place in which you stand can offer you many boons. All you must do is spend the power of Order.<br>
Alright, so. Now we come to the big big. You have 14, I believe, current Order. As the Heroes of Kalkatesh have ensured.
>
> You can use it to do all kinds of shit. Each tower gives a different boon, somewhat based off of its color, so to speak.<br>
Boons not just for you, but the entire of Kalkatesh.<br>
If you spend less than 4, then you focus on individualistic groups, or even a single person. If it's greater than that then it automatically goes on the chart, and it affects everybody.

The group confirms with Arcadum that The Enemy does not also gain a boon from Order spent here.

#### The Violet Scrolls

The group also confirms with Arcadum that The Scrolls received from Acorn all those years ago are safe to read here.

> **Party**: Is the Violet around us the same kind on the scrolls?:<br>
**Arcadum**: It is the same, yes.<br>
**Hackne**: Only the Gailen's Gate group originally is supposed to read this, right?
**Arcadum**: I can't answer that.

> **Arcadum**: The Shade will shift into many shades and show you all the Sevens from before in their last few moments before their iterations ending of them jotting into the scrolls.<br>
And then the Shade holds up his hand, and then it reveals something.<br>
Around each and every one of you there is a Violet Shroud. The Shade reveals that if there was a Violet corruption, it is already too late. By stepping through the gate it is already too late.<br>

The group resolves to *finally* read the scrolls.

> **Arcadum**: As you open the first scroll all of them open at the same time.<br>
The scrolls exit their cases, and all around you are the swirling storm of knowledge, the scrolls unravel and unfurl. Violet light shines down on those that would witness them.<br>
And this is what you get to know:
>
> Okay. So, congratulations you have finally read the scrolls and as such, I can reveal what I have been waiting to reveal for a long time now. And that is, for the longest time people have known that we're in the end game, but they lack the ability to see the board. Until now. As the scrolls have been opened they reveal to you the movements both cosmic and otherwise of the Enemy, and the undulating presence just barely seen, the resistance against the Enemy.<br>
So, here's what you get to know: The Herald's movements, its current completion rate, and, finally, what powers it has access to.
>
> Okay. So, first you're gonna start with the actual mapping out of how this battle goes down. As the Herald gets closer and closer and closer to Kalkatesh, it will send ahead of its tendrils of its own strength. This can be Violet Prophets attempting to corrupt those that would listen. It can also be used to summon forth Violet Servants to wreak havoc and destruction, and weaken Kalkatesh. And finally, the summoning of the Violet Towers. These great towering spires, more accurately. These towering spires are shot like spears through the land of Kalkatesh acting as beacons for all that follow the Violet infusing them with strength. Summoning them directly into the waking realm. These towers must be destroyed, at all costs.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: That is something that I am aware of, and we're planning contingencies on having those addressed. Some stream games are doing those, but there's going to be a strong living world push against the Towers as well.<br>
**Arcadum**: The next few pieces that you get are:<br>
The scrolls will also reveal how much longer that the Herald has in order to complete its journey, and destroy kalkatesh and the world. Right now the Herald plans to arrive in several months of both in and out of character time. Essentially this is where things get weird, cause the actual passage of these storylines are based on my own predictions of how long it'll take to get to certain points. And as such the Herald plans to arrive in *June 2021*.
>
> **Surefour (Bellanovan)**: So we pushed it back from that Traitor blade incident?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, that's if people are not to a certain point, it will be impossible to stop the Herald.<br>
**Surefour (Bellanovan)**: Any%, how's it looking this iteration? Is he positive or negative.<br>
**Arcadum**: If you must know, well, the Herald is certainly not in a good part of his "run", but it is still fairly early.
>
> And now the next is abilities the Herald has access to.
>
> The first one is:<br>
> * **The Herald Watches** - The Herald may turn its gaze directly on to a violet servants battle. If it does so it can augment the effects of that battle depending on the unique circumstances of that battle. Gives an extra ability to the Violet servant.
> * **Generate Servant** - Pretty straightforward.

> **Bellanovan**: Do we know the costs, or how it generates servants?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, you don't know the cost.<br>

> * **Fate Sever** - Fate Sever is a big one. If I ever get enough Entropy, after a certain threshold has been reached, which I have already reached it. If I have enough entropy, and if any single individual in any stream game, regardless of what they are fighting; if they should become unconscious I can immediately spend Entropy, if I have enough, I can force them to make a death saving throw against Violet Death.<br>
He has to be able to see, and if he's denied sight he won't be able to do it. But there's very few times that'll be the case.
>
> Scrolls also have on them secrets. You have three questions you may ask me, and I will answer.<br>
No cost, these answers are completely free, and there is only one question that you cannot ask me, and that is what the name of the Enemy is.

#### The Three Unbound Questions

> **Question 1**: What needs to be done to repair the broken covenant?
>
> **Arcadum**: This is what must be done. First, you must gather a World Seed. Second, you must face the Shattered Aeon once more, and defeat it, so that it may be made dormant then the World Seed placed within it. and third, you must expend an appropriate amount of Order to repair the covenant.<br>
**Ster (Gruff/Guy)**: Does the ziggurat have anything to do with the shattered aeon?<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: I don't believe there's any connection? An Aeon is basically the guardians and codifiers of law, of absolute law. They're not enemies, they're just very set in their way. But if the prism was shattered then the guardian might be corrupted.

> **Question 2**: Why does Violet Death erase the memory of the deceased?
>
> **Arcadum**: Violet Death erases the memory of the deceased because the covenants require each other. As there is a break in the Prism so too does the ultimate exit of this world be augmented in this way. The lifestream must continuously flow, but there is a hole in which the lifestream leaks away, and the further that light gets away from that prism the darker it becomes. Violet Death is essentially the removal of life from the lifestream completely, and such a thing wilts away into nothing.
>
*But it does not disappear*.
>
And now, something else happens.
>
> You gain an additional question, but this one is not granted to you by a Violet source, but by knowledge of purest black, of darkest night. And a new presence enters the board. It is not Lord Death, for there is something else, just on the edge of existence.<br>
For many look to the Traitor, that which Mercy was given unbehest, of which the Prism was shattered, and make no mistake, the Enemy is a power above them all. But in that act, in that one. singular. act; who was the one who showed Mercy? Not have they been spoken of, nor mentioned. For the guardian of Memory failed in their duty and as such were forgotten by all, until now.

> **Question 3**: What are the coordinates we can use to find the Traitor’s Blade?
>
> **Arcadum**: The Traitor's Blade is found within an oceanic rift, straight into the center of the Sickened Sea. It is surrounded by a swirling protective song of destruction and ruin, the opposite of the Song of Creation. The Chant of Oblivion holds back any that would touch it, including those that are Violet Servants. Slowly they must unravel the secrets of the chant in order to earn their masters respect and acquire the blade. There it waits.

(Ster has a revelation about this being what the Herald’s Call is)

> **Arcadum**: If it's a song, then it can be learned. And you happen to have a Chord with you.

<br>

End of session. Boons and Guardian of Memory will be dealt with next session.
