## Relevant Lore

### Sevenic Speech during Moe’s Clash Against the Speaker

> The strength of this Seven's soul outpaces the ones of before. The Seven remembers its comrade for those that have been sacrificed before.
>
> The wizard stands with the druid, Rannec places his hand upon Menthis's shoulder. She turns her eyes full of sorrow as if to ask "Is it truly my time?" Rannec will nod, for he has made a place for her, with all of their friends. She will smile, and they will walk away together.
>
> Their time in this world is done. The light of the Seven dims further, swirling, shifting, and fading. And like a nova of light, like that of an exploding star, this great sacrifice pays for it all. The Speaker falls to its knee, its lantern shattered, its cloak fringed. Ozzie's eyes open, life and strength return to him, and all the wounds for those that stand for Kalkatesh know not pain or fear any longer. Heroes, choose two abilities and seal them.


### Discount Ahst's Investigation of "Bright Light"

It seems that somehow in the encampment somehow or some one has planted a strange staff into the earth. She describes she had taken from it these two shards (Oblivion shards).

The staff will bear a curious mark; it bears the mark of the Green Triangle.

### Minthis' Wedding Ring

In front of Moe there is a golden wedding ring. Inside it says:

> To Minthis,
>
> Thanks for not killing me

### Braktor’s Speech to the Violet Speaker

> I already told you once: Though you silence our voices, we will speak. And though you break our bodies, we will stand. And though you bring our deaths we will live. But sending you is an insult, you were a sister to me, and you still are somewhere. He took everything from me in every single life, and I'll be damned if he takes her, he takes yet another thing and I'm just going to accept it.
>
> These men and women never asked to be here, but they never flinched from it. Shouting in the face of defeat, standing for one more day of honor for our world, and dignity for these people. Battling unimaginable odds, they've taken their place along the barrier that divides us from destruction, and even as the hand of death sweeps over them time and time again, they have stared into the certainty of oblivion and smiled. They will bring justice to you and yours, and bring what is hidden in shadows to the light.
>
> Maybe our time is up, but our job is mostly done. We've given them hope. Even now all of these souls here, and thousands of others, shout their wishes for salvation, for theirs, ours, and even his. That’s hope and I shall give it to you. Through revelation or severance, or I will return to my stone doing so. My rage, my suffering, is not the mark of a madman; it is the wound of a warrior. It is a sigh that no matter what horrors one might face they can still rise above the chaos, smile despite the tragedy, and rise again.
>
> Because you could be right, our spark is fading. But the Seven will not die forgotten. I'm little more than a candle in a sea of darkness now, but before you snuff me out I will start a luminous fire. And now, you're going to witness me, **THIS IS MY POWER TOO**! And I'm going to show you **EXACTLY WHAT THIS SOUL CAN DO**!
