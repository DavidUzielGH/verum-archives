### Braktor & Erin Speak in Camp

> **Erin**: I’ve been debating bringing it up or not, but I figured you know what’s the worst that could happen?<br>
**Braktor**: Everyone could die.<br>
**Erin**: Honestly I’m okay with that.<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah, you know, the more I- well not everyone, I would save a few people.<br>
**Erin**: Who?<br>
**Braktor**:I don’t want to get into it because then people are going to call me a simp.<br>
**Erin**: Oh, Hackne, okay.<br>
**Braktor**: What? She’s like- she’s the only friend I have.<br>
**Erin**: That’s sad, bruh.<br>
**Braktor**: Look- look at who I’m with! I- I like them, and I love them like brothers and, you know, in battle it’s just-<br>
**Erin**: So what would you do if you didn’t have them anymore?<br>
**Braktor**: I would… Look, do you want my honest answer?<br>
**Erin**: Yeah.<br>
**Braktor**: For all the grump and anger and indignance, I would just keep goin’, partially because, you know, it’s just baked into being a dwarf. You weather the storm. You’re a rock. The wind might carve away at you a bit, but you stand. And the second half of it is… I could- I could say a word, destroy it all but… who would I be, then? I spent all this time trying to stop something terrible from happening and I would be no better than the evil I fight if I decided to do the same exact thing.<br>
**Erin**: Would it even be so bad if everything got destroyed?<br>
**Braktor**: Look… I don’t know. They’ve- I’ve been told that there’s always something else waiting, something in line, but… From what I understand to be destroyed in this way is a relief. You don’t go and soak in some afterlife wishing you could have done more, you just stop. But the way I see it, I don’t want to give this burden to some other people. If it- if it happens? It happens. I believe that fate is what it must be but, I’m not gonna stand here and just shirk my duty to give to someone else. I won’t let others suffer the way I have and the way I’ve seen others suffer.<br>
**Erin**: Fair enough.<br>
**Braktor**: But for what it’s worth, I know we call it evil, and yeah by a lot of metrics it is. I don’t think it’s evil, I just think it is. Evil is something that you can quantify, that you can reason with. Evil has goals, even if they’re... madness or being so damaged you do something absurd. This is just- it’s too deliberate, too planned to be chaotic but too benefit-less to be evil, it just- it is.
>
> **Erin**: Listen, I’m just gonna cut to the chase.<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah?<br>
**Erin**: I’m worried about you. Well, I see that you’re noble and you’ve been trying to do the right thing, so I don’t think that you are intentionally going to do anything that would endanger everyone here, but I have to be certain on a simple thing. I’m just gonna bluntly ask, are any of your refractions Tyre?<br>
**Braktor**: They are not. They… know of Tyre.<br>
**Erin**: Yeah, see, I was worried because, you hate yourself like all dwarves and you just keep walkin’ around saying he’s an asshole, so I was like, it’s gotta be him.<br>
**Braktor**: Oh, he is an asshole. I- I-<br>
**Erin**: Do you really think so?<br>
**Braktor**: Look, I can tell you with one-hundred percent assurance that Tyre had good intentions. Tyre was trying to do the right thing. Tyre was trying to save everything. But, Tyre was absolutely, one-hundred percent fucking evil. Like, by the gods, there was nothing that man wouldn’t do. He- O-oh well, then again, the more I learn about Tyre the less I’m certain this is true.<br>
He apparently had a brother who disowned him because he basically was the reason they had to start the Mage’s Guild. He did such horrendous shit, he doomed multiple worlds, and for what it’s worth, because I- I get this, um… Everyone is the hero of their own story and Tyre personally told me that he’s only doing what he’s doing because he knows that his ass is on the fire. And what he did, what he chose to do, all the good he did, is because he knew his time was coming to an end and he would rather- and much like I said, he would rather die fighting than just give up and submit to an inevitability.
>
> **Erin**: Do you know for sure if he was a human or not?<br>
**Braktor**: I don’t fuckin’ know what Tyre is, I didn’t even find him on Kalkatesh.<br>
**Erin**: So did you meet him as a refraction of himself, or had he already been too far gone?<br>
**Braktor**: I imagine, given what we know now with all this Labyrinth business, that I must have met one of his refractions. It’s hard to explain- He was disguised as an extra-planar creature from a- from a different planet. We met him in incredible circumstances.<br>
**Erin**: What creature was he?<br>
**Braktor**: He was disguised as an Astran. Whether that was an elaborate disguise to fool the people on Erast into infiltrating their high courts, I cannot say. Their magic was very potent. My personal belief is that Tyre was a Kalkateshian humanoid, possibly human-<br>
**Erin**: I assumed so, but I need to be sure.<br>
**Braktor**: When I met him he was disguised as an- as an Erastian-
>
> **Erin**: Do you have any idea how he would possibly be related to the Trigram?<br>
**Braktor**: It’s possible that he was a Vega-<br>
**Erin**: That’s what I’m wondering.<br>
**Braktor**: Of that I can’t say… Tyre was something that defied definition and he was never intimate with details, because he knew being in our presence made him even more vulnerable to something that was already happening to him, something was-<br>
**Erin**: So he knew you were a Seven?<br>
**Braktor**: Yes, he knew everything. He never mentioned the refractions, but, given what we’re doing at this Labyrinth I think the inevitable he was trying to fight against was just as inevitable as he feared. He asked us to do everything we can to assist him and then to kill him once he was no longer of use.
>
>**Erin**: Hm. Alright well, had to clear that up, bruh. Oh also, divinity shards.<br>
**Braktor**: Hooo boy. I knew divinity shards by a different name. Maybe what I knew them as was just a greater part of- or just a lesser part of what I found but, I would be very careful if you decide to mess around with one.<br>
**Erin**: What does it even do?<br>
**Braktor**: For the Seven they were… tools that could be used against what was to come. But they were dangerous. To open yourself up to one, it could grant you powers, knowledge, arms, and for lack of a better word deathlessly loyal servants. But just like anything else, these calculated risks we take, they made you ever more clear to the final ending of all things.<br>
**Erin**: I’m- I’m as clear as I feel like I’m ever gonna be, so if that’s the downside then I’m not that worried about it.<br>
**Braktor**: If you did try to manipulate one I could certainly try to help. Although, I’ve only ever personally, individually used one on my own and it almost killed some of us.<br>
**Erin**: To what end did you use it?<br>
**Braktor**: Knowledge.<br>
**Erin**: Oh, so it’s useless.<br>
**Braktor**: Well, there’s something you have to understand, and I imagine that maybe you know this being a Cardinal, which, that Antonius fellow is also a Cardinal. Apparently he, his name’s Derok Dranf and he’s a guy I killed a couple times and apparently- Well like I said, fate is- it puts us all on the board for a reason, but- The Seven were able to absorb this knowledge without fear.<br>
The danger came from attempting to steal that knowledge away from its owner. He did not care for us much. It was the role of the Cardinal to hear that knowledge from the Seven and present it to everyone else in a way that they could understand and that they could hear without going mad. Otherwise, you would have to have an absolute will to withstand that sort of knowledge and there was only- there were only two beings that I ever knew to be able to do it. One was able to remove the information from his mind after learning it. And the other, well- I don’t- I don’t quite know. But she basically tortured herself to the brink of death and destruction and ruin that, while she was effected, she was able to force all this knowledge, its terrible influence away. From what I understand, she had a lot of assistance from deities and blah blah blah.<br>
**Erin**: Would… Would Igor know more?<br>
**Braktor**: Oh, you see now, Igor is a Servant. From what I am to understand, Servants of the Seven were- and look, this is going to sound bad, and it sort of is, but I guess it’s not true anymore, because they were basically slaves to the Seven’s will.<br>
**Erin**: Okay, I’m gonna break this down, I just need the cliff notes. ‘Cause the way I see this thing, it’s a powerful tool, but also it’s knowledge so it’s pointless.<br>
**Braktor**: Yes, and as for Igor, there are things that he can know, but as a Servant, he will know what not to know.<br>
**Erin**: Okay, I’m gonna ask one question, and it’s gonna sound crazy-<br>
**Braktor**: Yep, used to that.<br>
**Erin**: Uh… is- would it, the shard, help to kill gods?<br>
**Braktor**: Certainly. And I pray that what you have isn’t exactly the same as what I’m thinking of, but- You have to take into account, something that can kill a god can certainly also make a god. It’s all the same energy.<br>
**Erin**: Well, if you ask me, I’m gonna say something else crazy, I think they all gotta go.<br>
**Braktor**: That- in the old days when there were actual Seven, and no offense to anyone, but like, they were organized and not fucking dying off or fucking off to go do their own thing, they had ways to handle these. And there were powerful individuals that could contain them safely until they were needed. Now, yeah, probably the best thing to do is just get rid of them.
>
> **Braktor**: If you don’t mind me asking, how did this come about?<br>
**Erin**: The shard?<br>
**Braktor**: Yes.<br>
**Erin**: I… oh god, you don’t wanna know.<br>
**Braktor**: I feel like I do because no one ever says you don’t wanna know unless they wanna know.<br>
**Erin**: Seren has the Brass King in her head and Oloken’hai rubbed up against him and apparently the Depthar had a Shard of Divinity and it revealed the location of Tyre’s Heart.<br>
**Braktor**: They would… I haven’t told anyone this, but I once made a deal with the overmind, th-the big one, the big lad.<br>
**Erin**: I’m not surprised.<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah, y-you tend to get into those... shenanigans. That was probably the worst timeline-<br>

Arcadum asks Sean if he remembers the terms of the deal, and he does not.

> **Arcadum**: It was stated that the overmind would demand flesh for service and the Seven accepted his deal as long as he did not demand it until after The Enemy had been defeated. When the Seven fought The Enemy during the Great Reckoning, and the paths were sealed, that means that oath was transferred into Babylon’s domain because the oath was upkept. Now, the overmind is in another place, so therefore, it took some time for that oath to be fulfilled. It took until the Price family, in Dolten, had a daughter. And through the confines of fate flesh was given to service.

> **Braktor**: Seren doesn’t happen to have a last name, does she?<br>
**Erin**: Not that I know.<br>
**Braktor**: We made a deal with the overmind that he’d be given flesh once all the problems with the enemy were resolved and technically they were. And because it was a Kalkateshian promise it was triaged by Babylon and from what I understand, there was a family in Dolten by the last name of Price whose daughter came into this power. Of course, fate’s tricky like that, so I’m wondering if Seren had made this deal? If that is not Seren? I do not know her, personally.<br>
**Erin**: Wait, you’re wondering if Seren isn’t Seren?<br>
**Braktor**: I mean, she could be Seren, it’s just, maybe her last name-<br>
**Erin**: Well does it matter?<br>
**Braktor**: Maybe it’s just that her last name is Price.<br>
**Erin**: What matters is how do we stop the Depthar from spreading?<br>
**Braktor**: Fire.<br>
**Erin**: Seren is immune to fire.<br>
**Braktor**: Well shit. Um, well, you just gotta kill ‘em. If you kill ‘em, they stop just like anything else. Other than that you need, you need potent curative magics. Like, the highest form- if you catch it really early you can just use a simple lesser restoration. But, if an overmind got into Seren’s head? I don’t think we’re gettin’ rid of that. How did you find out about these overminds? Gruff mentioned once that when he was a fish for a little bit, that he was, that he was going to find the Leviathans?<br>

Sean asks Arcadum what Gruff would have told Braktor about the Leviathans.

> **Arcadum**: Gruff knows that the Leviathans are why you can’t cross the ocean between continents and only during the Festival of the Seven do the Leviathans sleep. Erin knows that the Leviathans are in fact those kinds of beasts. Erin also knows that there is one Leviathan who serves as guardian of the continent of Kalkatesh against his brethren and that is the individual that gave Erin the knowledge of the Wave Gates.

> **Braktor**: So, maybe this is my memory being rusty but, I also, I have a vague recollection of the Leviathans not only being the physical guardians of the plane. As in literally they defend the Prime Material Plane from prime material threats, but I believe they also defend from extra-planar threats. So if another plane decided "hey, we’re going to invade the Prime Material-" and I mean, I don’t mean Fire, Water, Earth, Air, all that stuff, I mean the planets and whatnot. If they decided to cause trouble, I do believe it would be the Leviathans responsibility to stop that, so if-<br>
**Erin**: Yeah, they- Here’s where things currently are, and we’re- I guess you were leading down this path- I’m unclear on the details, but I know that the Leviathans are well aware of what the Sevens' broken covenant is.<br>
**Braktor**: Well that is a question, ‘cause I know what it is but I don’t think it’s the one-<br>
**Erin**: Well-<br>
**Braktor**: And I’m not gonna say it, it’s probably gonna kill everyone.<br>
**Erin**: Yeah, we should probably say less words at this point.<br>
**Braktor**: Point being is if the Leviathans through you know that Seren is working with an overmind and they’ve let her live, it’s quite possible that they’ve sanctioned an invasion. Whether they see it as such is questionable-<br>
**Erin**: They did seem cooperative for now.<br>
**Braktor**: I think for the moment we should trust Seren.<br>
**Erin**: Fuck.<br>
**Braktor**: Well obviously reasonable precautions should be taken.<br>
**Erin**: Well- I- Okay, let’s wrap this up. I assume at the end of the Labyrinth we’ll have some access to the leyline and we could probably solve these problems.<br>
**Braktor**: Here’s hoping. I don’t think we’re gonna get an overmind out of Seren’s head but, if that overmind really wanted to harm us it would have just consumed Seren and used her power to start an invasion.<br>
**Erin**: Alright, yeah. Yeah, I’ll look into this whole divinity shard thing and figure out how to kill gods, that’s what I’m doin’ today. You have a great evening.<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah I feel like I’m not gonna. Probably going into this godforsaken dungeon...

Erin and Braktor move back to Erin’s pool.

> **Braktor**: Also, I’m gonna go check in with him now, but maybe talk to Antonius slash Derok. It probably will mean more coming from Cardinal to Cardinal to explain his purpose.<br>
**Erin**: Bruh, why do you think I’m a Cardinal?<br>
**Braktor**: Well, if my previous knowledge is any indication, because your life has taken a horribly fucked up turn and someone decided that you’re advantageous.<br>
**Erin**: Okay, second question, how many were there? I assumed there was one.<br>
**Braktor**: I always thought so as well. I only ever met one each go-around.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Alright, this I can answer for you because you actually know this answer, Sean. Normally there is only one, per refraction. One per group.

> **Braktor**: I only ever met one, but I’ve met different Cardinals in different refractions, so as many refractions as there were, which again I’m pretty sure I know, but-<br>
**Erin**: Hold on, I’m not sure if I’m gettin’ that right. So… does that mean Tyre is every Cardinal?<br>
**Braktor**: I’m not certain. It’s just that he was one of them. But- well, I don’t know if Tyre was a- was the first or whatnot. But, like I said, Tyre did unnatural things, things that disturbed a great many things.<br>
**Erin**: Okay, second question, if that were true in any way, how- would it be possible that the Cardinal is a Depthar, and it’s multiple people?<br>
**Braktor**: I think you’re-<br>
**Erin**: I think I’m way off, I’m just- gotta say words sometimes.<br>
**Braktor**: I… I knew of ways to access the knowledge of refractions, so it’s very possible that Tyre simply learned that information himself.<br>
**Erin**: Yeah, I was gonna- How’re you doing that?<br>
**Braktor**: I found- well I was made aware of this information by someone who knew me in the past, so they unlocked what I had stored away. I can’t quite explain that, but in one of my go-arounds, I found a guide and I can’t speak any more about it.<br>
**Erin**: Alright, run along.
