(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/yunJUgiE0z4?t=6496))

> **Arcadum**: As you place the key within the lock, the flame turns to a shade of violet, and the world falls away. You find yourself standing, amongst the infinite possibilities of the astral sea. All around you the six nebulae form into a singular star pattern and in the center, lies Verum. It pulses, with unknown potential and you can see that the sphere, broken into its many pieces, undulates and swirls in the infinite celestial cycle.
>
> The flame begins to grow in power, and there you see in the eyes of the shadow. For once, many years ago, during the Great Reckoning, one of the Seven stood against a terrible tyrant of fire. He sought the flames, and brought them down upon Daborak. The plains and wheat fields burned, the people starved, and the children watched, their parents, die. In the ashen storm, he stood and raised the sword of Jordan. And with his memory, held fast against the tyrant of flame.
>
> All around you you see them. People moving to and fro,crying out in fear, and in the turmoil of the roiling war of the bandits of the North once again the Seven stood. Fearing for themselves, but caring more for the people around them. They held fast through pain, and flame, and blood. And with each foe struck, the sword sang, a terrible hymn.>
>
> It is here, that you see the flame morph again.
>
> You see through the eyes of the Seven once more. A year has passed and they stand, on the precipice of a dark chasm, and deep, down below in the shadows, serpents seem to turn, and twist, and stare, and hunger. Their salivating maws snapping and twisting up. The seven leaps the chasm, for what they seek are the stolen memories of the children they now serve. For at their side lie several dolls tied to their belt. Good luck charms and reminders for the cost of war.
>
> As they move through the caverns, it turns instead to sunlight. As you see another memory yet unfurl before you.
>
> There, is a cemetery, with far too many stones. The weight is heavy and the fire of hatred is hot. For your target is made clear. There standing on the hill nearby is the tyrant himself. With the sword of Jordan in your right hand and the flames of Lorita in your left. The Seven stands and fails. The failure courses through you, Kyros. For not all heroes succeed. The sword of Jordan lies broken in your hands. The dolls consumed to ash. As your life fades, your soul drifts. But there is something else, a violet presence that does not allow this story to end. Your soul returns from the void, to the charred ground and the shattered homes. The weight of your guilt is too much. So you decide instead to make a different choice. You reforge the sword, with the flames, with the tears of your very soul, and offer yourself up as penance to Lorita, the Goddess of Wrath, in the hopes that your anger, your hatred, can find recourse.
>
> And then your soul is lifted as all around you, slow at first, quiet just beyond your ability to hear. Voices begin to cry out. Not in pain or sorrow, but rather in song and chant. And as they rise up, louder and louder, the symbol upon the earth begins to be etched. And then you feel your own voice rise up and join them and the chorus begins. And as these words begin to be whispered all around you, you feel the Sevenâ€™s heart relieved of the weight.<br>
And as this happens, your soul is free. And your penance accepted.You return to your own body Kyros, with your hand on the key within the lock. Now, what is your choice?

(*General talk about how good Arcadum is*)

> **Arcadum**: The choices are this:
>
> Turn the key and release the soul. By doing so that means the pennant is also released.<br>
Or allow the soul which chose this path to continue to pay for his mistakes.
>
> So the question is this: Do you wish to take up the responsibilities for this soul? Or allow him to return to his prison?

(*Deciding*)
> **Kyros**: I will turn the Key<br>
**Arcadum**: You turn the key. The lock is undone. And the fire fades, and instead you stand there, alone with Melany. A whisper. A shade unseen. And finally, all that you saw fades into memory. And you stand... alone.
>
> The shadows fade. You return to the waking realm. And the ashen corpse blows into dust on the wind. And instead, laying there before you is a bastard sword.
