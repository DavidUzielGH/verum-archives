### The Samurai's Mirror

Thanks to Panax for most of this transcription.

> **Arcadum**: Terryn, as you find yourself floating, kind of lost within the Astral Sea you suddenly straighten, and what you are seeing is a reflection of that which actually is, and all things are reversed. But then you feel a presence beside you.
>
> A man will approach, and will say:<br>
**Tomen**: Finally... Greetings sister. It is good to see you. My name is Tomen, and I am your brother.<br>

Terryn is brain boggled, and just looks at him.

> **Terryn**: Uh...<br>
**Tomen**: I can understand that you are overwhelmed. I will do what I can to explain.<br>
I'm the brother to all changelings I'm the only... Man, to be born from hag, and mortal. I was the first I was cast aside by the foul mother, the one that still awaits within the colopian(?) fields, but now is not the time for our history, I've come to speak of our future and what role we would have to play in the great spinning of the wheel.<br>
I have been freed from the Mirrored Realm and I come and go as I please, and now you have ventured here, oh sister of mine, and it fills my heart with joy for now all our people may once again have a home, a home that was always meant to be theirs. But I'm afraid that those days of utopia and plenty shall have to wait, for the Enemy beckons and grows ever closer. <br>
The violet light within the sky is empowered, the Seventh Eye has opened, and I am it's charge. And now your purpose is made anew, for there are two of your sisters that yet await you, for the trigram must be complete. It is the only way to find the lost isles of the Vega, and it is there that we shall find what we need to face the Enemy.<br>
You're trapped within the confines of circumstance, finish your duties, free your comrades and when you're done seek me out again, for there are greater rumblings, there is greater need and the Enemy moves with each passing step. I fear there may be more at stake within Bleak, I fear there are maybe more in all of Dolten and than there appears to be.<br>

> **Melody (Terryn)**: I... I... Nod and is he telepathic?<br>
**Arcadum**: You don't know.

> **Terryn**: What do I need to do?<br>
**Tomen**: First, you must free yourself in the eyes of their laws, and then seek me out again. I can sense your service to Wode, I will see if I cannot beseech him, beseech him to allow me to use you for what is needed. Wode is wise, and he is kindly... In his way.<br>
**Terryn**: Are you... Are you related to my dark lord?<br>
**Tomen**: No... Well, I suppose in a way. It was after all a dream that made us.<br>
**Terryn**: How-How long have you been?<br>
**Tomen**: I cannot say, long enough to know that it is longer than it should be, and yet not long enough to know the truth of time. I'm sorry sister there are limits to my knowledge, I can only give what recourse that I can and guidance where I may. Your compatriots worry about you, and you should return soon, but first there is someone, some people, that you should meet.<br>
***Terryn** nods.<br>
**Tomen**: These are the sisters that you must seek.<br>
***Arcadum** shows Ahst and Neve's tokens<br>
**Terryn**: Where can I find them?<br>
**Tomen**: You can find them across the sea, where a great labyrinth awaits. But your journey there will be rife with peril, for the Enemy moves, and the Enemy has seen into the mirrors by the actions of one of the Eyes. I have done what I can to contain its vision, and I intend to return it to the Eye in question, but it has already seen you, and it has seen your sisters.<br>
**Terryn**: Can you see the end?<br>
**Tomen**: I do not believe that anyone can see the true end, but I know what is to come. The wheel will turn, and we must be ready. Free yourself of the laws of Dolten, seek thee your sisters, open the trigram, find what the Vega have hidden. Only then will we have the hope that we need to face the Herald.<br>
**Terryn**: I understand.<br>
**Tomen**: Keep heart, Terryn, your people need you.
