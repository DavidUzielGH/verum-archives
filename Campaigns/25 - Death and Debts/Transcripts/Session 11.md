> **Madd Morc**: “My name’s Morc, what’s yours?”<br>
> **Eustace**: “I wouldn’t know anything about staying dry. I’m pretty much made of water, so if that’s the case be careful!”<br>

> ***Hackne Silvermask** nods appreciatively to Ozzie before sitting next to Braktor, leaning against him while she tries to process the *way too much* happening at once, and that’s saying a lot considering her party.<br>
> **Umi**: I feel sensory overload… *headlight is glowing like crazy*<br>
> **Vaeri**: *looks a little taken back* “People just usually talk down at me… I am Vaeri.”<br>
> **Seren**: “Do you know of an Orc Druid Seven Braktor? Its pretty vague but…. they are in our wing”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “I feel you, Umi.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: ?me collapses on the ground, not like hurting just – also overwhelemed<br>
> **Umi**: How does your hair work help *looks at eustace*<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** collapses on the ground, not like hurting just – also overwhelemed.<br>
> ***Ozzie** basks in the chaos<br>
> **♥Mirage♥**: “I am! I would love to hear your voice. You will find that music is very important here~”<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “Well you are tiny. But if you’re here at Camp Last Stand, you must be strong like us.”<br>
> ***Ozzie** summons some sexy satyrs.<br>
> ***Seren** Blinks at Braktor<br>
> **Wokou Kaizoku**: Mouse is it medicine time?<br>

> **♥Mirage♥**: “I would love that! Do you use your voice with your abilities or is it just a hobby of yours?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “That woman who saved Moe…… that was her husband. I talked to their daughter. Game them his ring. What’s going to happen to them now?”<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “Haw-haw, I once bi-sected a man in one stroke, from head to guts. It was pretty metal<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “… Will they remember?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “I don’t know.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I robbed Blackbriar.”<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** claps for Ozzie.<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Don’t tell anyone.”<br>
> **Drugs McGee**: “Bastian, say my name!!!”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: She gently tacks her pen against her book, “Do they have any diaries that you know of? It might help.”<br>
> **Seren**: “We…. we didn’t mean for that to happen Braktor…. we didn’t know that he knew…”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Maybe. Jonah will ask them.”<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** begins to stand, offering a hand to hackne as well<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Do you think Jonah knows Amaris?<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I guess you’d know if he knows”<br>
> **Vaeri**: *nodded quickly* “That’s… reallly metal. I know what its like to be metal… im a dragon”<br>
> **Seren**: “Who or whats a Jonah? Someone else at the camp?”<br>
> ***Hackne Silvermask** takes it, pulling herself up while she looks to Seren, nodding, “I do not think that you all are to be blamed for this. Intent matters in such things.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “It’s…….it’s fine.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “It’s Braktor’s refraction. He’s alive somewhere on Kalkatesh.”<br>
> **Drugs McGee**: (How did he fit in here…..)<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “You couldn’t have predicted he’d do what he did..<br>

> **Ozzie**: “I got a few myself. Apparently I am head of The Inquisition.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Ozzie, we should be careful about who we tell that kind of stuff.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Well they’re Last Standers, they’re cool”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “They need to know these things”<br>
> **Seren**: “Here lets… lighten up the mood abit. How did the wedding go Hackne and Braktor?”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “They might also need to find out about it *incrimentally* when it becomes relevant to them, Ozzie.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Well the camp was on fire but other than that it was brilliant.”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “Also there’s such a thing as information overload, let them time to adjust.”<br>
> ***Ozzie** holds his had in shame, having been slightly scolded by Hackne.”<br>
> **Seren**: “Oh gods…. I’m sorry we weren’t here to help more…”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I’m just a bird brain, I’m just happy to know what’s goin’ on half the time.”<br>
> ***Hackne Silvermask** separates from Braktor for but a moment to gently pat Ozzie on the leg—for that’s all she could reach. She isn’t truly bothered too much. She returns to Braktor shortly after, “We made a speaker run for the hills, Serene, it was a wonderful prelude.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Don’t gurt in the pool!”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “To the wedding that is.”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Wedding?<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “We were thinking once everything calms down – of doing a bigger one, you know? For everyone.”<br>
> **Seren**: “Well that does sound like one hell of an event”<br>
> **Vaeri**: *stutters and her tail curls nervously* “I am but a white dragon you see. Im just a little sunburnt.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Yeah, hackne and I got married.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I was the flower girl.”<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** offers a genuine smile<br>
> **♥Mirage♥**: “*whispers to guy* What happens when you drink from people? Are you also affected by this overwhelmingly pleasurable energy?<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Congratulations.<br>
> ***Ozzie** tosses a flower bud in the air and makes it blossom and float lightly to the ground.”<br>
> ***Seren** claps for Ozzie<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** smiles, though struggling a bit – it seems like this outweighs the death of his friend just enough.<br>
> **♥Mirage♥**: o_o<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Thanks”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “You can do that too, but thanks deer girl.”<br>
> **Guy**: You’re jaunting, Mirage<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I mean, Seren. I gotta start usin’ names”<br>

> **Derok Dranf**: I don’t even know who that is.<br>
> **Terryn Zabi**: Perception : 8 (7)<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “You’re the first white dragon I’ve met, nice to meetcha.” Morc will sit criss-cross apple sauce. “You mentioned Gross Derrick, how is he?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “The lady with the wings.”<br>
> **Eustace**: “The sun’ll burn your eyes if you keep lookin’ at it, Mirage.”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Oh.<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “Gruff walked me down the isle, and I had Mirage as my maid of honor.” She pauses before casting message (I would have chosen you in a heartbeat if you were there, but Mirage also LITERALLY saved my life during that same fight.)<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Oh, Derok. I made it with these two. At the same time.”<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** facepalms<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Wh..<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: N…nice?<br>
> **Ozzie**: “One’s a uh.. like Belanovan, and the other is.. a helper. I don’t know what I’m allowed ta say.”<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** shuffles.<br>
> ***Eustace** melbourne shuffles<br>
> ***Seren** giggles<br>
> ***♥Mirage♥** continues to stare, eyes wide open.<br>
> ***Hackne Silvermask** tilts her head slightly at Mirage, “Mirage? Are you… charmed or something?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Hold on”<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** weaves or some shit but is blocked by the chord<br>
> **Ozzie**: “It’s probably just a bard thing. Probably how they prepare spells or somethin”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Oh Shit/ plot’s probably happening.”<br>
> **Vaeri**: *would alsmot squee and sit down as well, sprawled a bit, tail all waggin like a dog a bit* “Ah, Sad shriveled man. He seems to be in some sewers taking care of falic mushrooms… just being.. sad”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “She’s not hurt, just – concentrating. It’s kind of like a Lifewell.”<br>
> **Seren**: “ooo”<br>
> **Seren**: “Oh shit”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Hey, Dragon girl.”<br>
> **Seren**: “I have to get you guys a wedding gift”<br>
> **Umi**: *suddenly wakes up and sits up yelling* “TENTACLES!!!”<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “Sad? That’s a shame. I will have to go check on him when this is over.” Cranes his head towards Ozzie. “Think he’s callin for ya.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Honewtly, Seren, the wedding was gift enough for me. I can’t ask for anything else.”<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: *sits down next to Umi and pats her head* “Have a nice dream little one?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: (Well expect for my staff to be upgraded or like, a level up but I’ll never get those)<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: Honestly*<br>
> **Seren**: “No no no, I insist. I could uuuuh… Get you alcohol?”<br>
> **Umi**: “There were so many tentacles!!” *hugs revlis*<br>
> **Ozzie**: “You’re cool lookin’. Don’t think I ever seen a dragon person before. Well, I guess I did once when it came out of Belanovan. I mean, when it.. nevermind.””<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “Yes, truly, seeing you all again is the best gift you could give.”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Uh.<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** points at Mirage.<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Guys<br>
> **Seren**: “oh…”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Oh, and…..it’s happening again.”<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: “The good kind or the bad king? Wait.. there is no bad kind!” *giggles and hugs her tightly, wrapping her wings around Umi lovingly*<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “What is the goddamn.”<br>
> **Guy**: Stop saying my name in vain.<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Is this normal for her?<br>
> **Umi**: *headlight glows and she laughs* Always good!! ^^*snuggles*<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Guys dammit<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “I wouldn’t know.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “It’s……no. But she’s…..her power has to do with the lifestream. She’s sending energy somewhere.”<br>
> **Vaeri**: *nods..* “He spoke of some woman hurting him so deeply he couldn’t rec-… hmm? Me? OH yes.. .Us dragons are quite mesmerising…. dont let my size confuse you, im… traveling this way …as to not garner to much unwanted attention”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: So it’s a good thing?<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Beats the hell out of me.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “fifty fifty?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “I’m worried anything we do will hurt Mirage….”<br>
> ***Seren** Squints at the Dhampir<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “We….should perhaps leave it be for now.”<br>
> **Drugs McGee**: O.o<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** adds his power to the squinting.<br>
> ***Guy** squints at the Satyr<br>
> **Seren**: “Oh… I do know you… The Shark right?”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “With all the weird shit we seen, a little trance ain’t much to be alarmed about. We’d see a bad-color enemy if they was here.”<br>
> ***Hackne Silvermask** drops a casual guidance on Seren. Her bias Is very clear.<br>
> ***♥Mirage♥** vibrates<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Bitch what? You know this fucker?<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Sorry Seren. Didn’t mean to call you that.<br>
> **Guy**: “Everybody knows me. Also, you owe me for those weapons, Derok.”<br>
> ***Guy** licks his lips<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** stares at his hammer.<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Didn’t you attack and molest him?”<br>
> **Seren**: “Remember when I went into the Dream to help Eustace…. I saw him and 5 others fighting. He was one”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Yeah I’m totally sure you gave this to me.<br>
> **Eustace**: “Hey I killed that shark ya know.”<br>
> **Guy**: “Molest is a strong word, it was one kiss!”<br>
> **Seren**: “When you know… I almost exploded.”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “It was only a kidd how did it end up like this?”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: You taste like cigarettes and body fluid.<br>
> **Umi**: *looks over at eustace* YOU KILLED A SHARK?! ;_;<br>
> **Guy**: “I convinced my entire group that we should send those weapons to you. I’m the good guy, here.”<br>
> ***Braktor Ironbellows** facepalms<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Oh so you went from sacrificing me to charity. That makes snese.<br>
> **Eustace**: “It was a mutant violet shark, it was threatening the existence of all dreams. Turst me, I’m with you.”<br>
> **Derok Dranf**: Snese btw<br>
> **Umi**: *starts muttering in spanish* ;___;<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** vibrates for a reason.<br>
> **Guy**: “You have to fuck things up a bit before you know whats wrong, right? It’s a destructive patter but it gets the job done eventualy.”<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** vibrates intently for a reason<br>
> ***Eustace** thinks to himself “What kind of fantasy language are they speaking.?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Hey – Zara, Vaeri. You seem the most sane. Did you have questions about your mission? About whats happening here?”<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “Uh oh.” She scribbles in her book. (A sudden twist, a betrayal revealed, a guilt shared, and regret spent the two lovers that longed for the ocean still had their hearts momentarily broken, then mended with their bond…) etc etc.<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: *makes guttural shark sounds behind Umi*<br>
> ***Seren** approaches the smol mermaid girl.<br>
> **Seren**: “Eustace…. you ready for Operation Fish Bowl?”<br>
> ***Derok Dranf** vibrates with anger.<br>
> **Vaeri**: *just kinda sits there, happy to be part of the conversation as a dragon* “Oh… I havnt really the slightest clue… but its better than a sewer”<br>
> **Zara**: “Questions?.... Mmmm….” Zara would seem a bit tipsy “NONE AT ALL!”<br>
> **Umi**: Wait what… fish bowl??<br>

> **Umi**: D:<br>
> **Seren**: “Its time Eustace”<br>

> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Umi……..long name?”<br>
> **Eustace**: “Hey Umi, wanna swim and fly at the same time?<br>
> **Umi**: w…wwwww..wwwhat is happening<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: “The only question I have is if our friends are okay..”<br>
> **Umi**: Am I going to die if I do?<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I can fly. I only carry around my gnome friend though ‘cause she’s earned it.”<br>
> **Eustace**: “Well I sure hope not.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Don’t Worry. Ahst will protect them. I’d trust her with my life.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “And Neve usually does what Ahst does so, double trusted.”<br>
> **Vaeri**: *fiddles with a stone that has a hat and holes on it and look to Braktor* “Hmm… What exactly is in it for you all… to be here?”<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: “You can fly?!” Shall we…fly together? Want to race? I’ve been trapped in sewers for so long, I have yet to properly stretch my wing…”<br>
> **Seren**: “Control the water Eustace… IM GOING IN”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “It’s our destiny to be here.”<br>
> ***Hackne Silvermask** visibly perks up at Ozzie’s claim, scribbling more happily before she nods in agreement with Braktor, “Ahst doesn’t tolerate anyone’s bullshit. They’ll be fine.”<br>
> **Umi**: O__O<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Much like you all, we have our roles to play in this war against the end of all things.”<br>
> ***Seren** turns into a Koi fish and swims in the water<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I’m the guy who dies.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I died twice, by the way.”<br>
> **Guy**: “Stop using my name in vain…”<br>
> **Umi**: Omg… she turned into a fish!<br>
> ***Eustace** sniffles a bit. “He was a koi fish when I met him..” ;_;<br>
> ***Seren** blub blubs<br>
> **Umi**: Wait..are you asking me to jump into your ocean? We just met… *headlight glows*<br>
> **Hackne Silvermask**: “Please stop dying, Ozzie, it makes me sad.”<br>
> **Umi**: *shows her tiny tooth*<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Well someone’s gotta do it… I assume.”<br>
> **Revlis (Revvy)**: *squeals gleefully at the koi fish*<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “I was sent to deliver your mission to you. But, uh, I wrote the map in Dwarvish. I was…..I had a long night.:<br>
> ***Seren** Pogs as a fish<br>
> **Eustace**: “Sorry, are you more of a dinner and a play kind of gal before you go swimming with someone?”<br>
> ***Madd Morc** suddenly sniffs the airs, sensing another, new fighter on the island.<br>
> **Ozzie**: “Oh, who wants me to turn them into an animal?”<br>
> **Madd Morc**: “A… Samurai..?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: (POWERUP?)<br>
 > **Umi**: Hmm… I usually try to get to know someone first but ill make an exception since you arean ocean man… can I go in there?<br>
> ***Eustace** before even answering, Eustace moves the ball of water to encase Umi and lift her into the air.<br>
> ***Wokou Kaizoku** feels the presence of a strong individual<br>
> **Wokou Kaizoku**: “I feel a strong champion in the midst, Lord Darkwater”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: (Yknow Wokou can come chill with us)<br>
> **Vaeri**: *seems sad for a moment but stands up*<br>
> **Wokou Kazioku**: (im not sure im actually here yet sean lmao)<br>

> ***Madd Morc** looks down on Vaeri, “Hey dragon-lady, what kinda adventurer are ya? Spell casty or beat ‘em up?”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Ozzie why do you WANT to drown?”<br>
> **Eustace**: “I wouldn’t go swimming in the sea here, but we’ll figure something out! Never met a mermaid, to swim with one would be a tale to tell.”<br>
> **Ozzie**: “I was havin’ a bad day, mate.”<br>
> **Braktor Ironbellows**: “Well talk to us next time instead of trying to drown yourself.”<br>
