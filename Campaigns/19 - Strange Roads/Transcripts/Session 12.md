### Zacharius Clashes The Herald

> **Arcadum**: Zacharius, as you lift your glasses, your violet eye no longer covered- as you look at the Callous King you are able to see something that you did not see before. The Callous King is merely one of two halves. The other is of Hector Highfall; the spirit is yet uncorrupted. They are in a constant battle, one that Hector is doomed to lose, but even now as his corpse, as his body fights to kill you, he struggles against it, trapped in a cage of violet and iron. 

> **Arcadum**: Listen well, Dodger. Zacharius can attempt to free Hector Highfall from the cage. If you do so, the King’s Guard will be summoned to aid you. However, if you fail, you will risk violet death. So, the choice is yours.

(All discuss the risks and rewards of doing so)

> **Dodger**: Fuck it, sure.

> **Arcadum**: You focus your violet eye upon the creature’s form. and then it turns and looks at you And The Herald sees. Once again, one of these imputent upstarts challenges it. It has already lost before; it will not do so again. Violet energy surges from the Callous King as The Herald’s gaze turns to challenge you. The temple falters. The statue of Cassius begins to crack. It will destroy you all. But your hope is not so easily extinguished. You meet the creature’s gaze. You will free the imprisoned king, or you will die trying.

> Zacharius, make me a wisdom saving throw.

> **Arcadum**: The Herald’s gaze fires out from the Callous King and pushes Zacharius backwards, slamming him into the adjacent pillars. Like wind on a fly, it crushes him against the wall. However, slowly, he lifts himself up, pushing back against the gaze. The siren’s song surges behind him, pushing him forward like wings lifted with wind. Your eye does not close. Your focus does not falter. The Herald had underestimated you. The prison of the king shatters. Hector Highfall materializes before you. With a smile, he will raise his sword and will say, “King’s Guard! At my side!” And four King’s Guard will join the fray.
