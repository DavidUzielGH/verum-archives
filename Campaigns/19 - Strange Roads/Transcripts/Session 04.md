# Strange Roads -- Session 04

## Relevant Lore

The party returns to the Lord Commander with the corpse of the necromancer in tow, proving their innocence. They are released, and Jaquier offers the party employment as his caravan's bodyguards in exchange for passage to the west. The party agrees and goes to spend the night in a tent alongside the rest of the caravan. During the night the party meets some of the members of the caravan, and Zacharius has another meeting with Gambler Black, which Arcidamus sees in secret. The party eventually retires for the night, and the caravan starts moving again the very next day. Eventually the caravan finds itself stuck trying to cross muddy roads, but the party is able to help the carts along. Further ahead, the party finds an injured man who points the party to a temple to Cassius that has been taken over by heathens. The party approaches the temple which doubles as a fort and debates for a long time what the best way to get inside was, eventually deciding that they would have Beryl try to approach in the image of a sexy bandit with Arcidamus and Zacharius as his prisoners, which fails immediately. The party steels themselves for a head-on fight with the inhabitants of the fort.
