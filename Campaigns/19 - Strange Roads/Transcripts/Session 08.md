### Sevenic Speech

(Session [timestamp](https://youtu.be/KuJpgy-gPr4?t=6380))

Tomen approaches and offers his hand to Zach:

> **Arcadum**: Do you take it?<br>
**Dodger**: I’ll take it.<br>

> **Arcadum**: He will smile and nod. He will grab one of the pieces of reality and will tear it from the cracked mirror. He will concentrate upon it, shifting its form and twisting it until finally it shows the symbol of The Seven. The symbol of The Seven shows six of the seven points tipped in a violet light and now the seventh begins to burn. He will look to Zacharius and will lift the mirror to his eye.
>
> A power flows from the symbol surging into Zacharius’ eye. And as it pulses through, Zacharius begins to see the truth of things. Of those that walked before, and of those that yet walk beside, and an uncertain future. The shadows of The Seven, the heroes from all those years ago that stood together to stave off the end of all creation now pass their torch to you. And to six others that walk unseen.
>
> You begin to see them now. One by one you see yourself, you see a Kenku, you see a Vampiric person, you see a Dwarf, you see a Goblin. Further you look, the other two appear to be wrapped in shadow; you can’t quite make them out. But still, the same two stand beside you. One of them will let forth a roar and the shadows uncoil around him, and you will see an Orc. The last one remains unseen.
>
> And then, each of you lose your color, your image, your sense of self, and it fades away until you stand like the others, shadows of power, fragments of memory -- a single strand of hope. 
>
> Before you, Kalkatesh opens up. Creation yawns like a maw and the Herald beckons closer.
>
> Time is broken. The way ahead is clear. The seventh Eye has been opened and as such the end-game can truly begin.<br>
Tomen will take the seven-pointed star from your eye, Zacharius.

> **Arcadum**: Which eye do you choose?<br>
**Dodger**: Uh, the left eye.

> **Arcadum**: Your left eye now burns bright with a violet light, your pupil refracted into seven points. You now see as they do, feel as they do, and you are burdened with terrible purpose. And with that, the fragment will shatter. The mirror will fade and Tomen’s purpose is fulfilled.
