# Strange Roads -- Session 09

## Relevant Lore

Everyone in the party except for Arcidamus, who is too busy drinking to do anything, decides to continue searching the waystation. They approach the ghost in the courtyard that Gallan talked to in a previous episode. The ghost warns the party of another tower the party has yet to explore. The ghost recounts that once a doll maker came through who carried a black mirror and had violet lips. The party enters the tower and finds a huge fancy keg. They open the keg's false face to reveal many dolls hanging from the top of the barrel, and a corpse accompanied by a black cracked mirror in the back. Zacharius summons Wise Guy, who was returned to him by Babylon, and commands him to retrieve the mirror. Zacharius looks into the mirror and the god Wode is summoned, confused that his follower is missing, and that Tomen, his prisoner, is no longer in the area. Wode looks behind him, seeing the body of his follower, and moves to it. The corpse springs at Wode, biting him and infecting him with violet energy. As Wode is being corrupted, Mirage becomes his follower in an attempt to give him enough power to fight the violet. It works, and Wode crushes the violet before rewarding Mirage with new power. Wode leaves, and the party exits the tower. Arcidamus, upon learning all of this, becomes angry that Zacharius and Mirage could be so evil, blaming Zacharius for most of it. He storms off, and Koordrin follows to console him, reminding them they still have a job to do. The party returns to the caravan and they are able to move through the infested forest uncontested. As the caravan moves along, the party finds a Tortle stuck under a tree. They save the Tortle, whose name is Gorgonsloth, who claims he was sent by Astaroth to speak with the first minotaur he saw and tell them that Astaroth has picked out a mate for them. This person is in Krazax, in the undercolloseum, the Red Raven. Gorgonsloth calls on Gallan to help Koordrin accept marrying the Red Raven. Koordrin asks Gorgonsloth to come along, but he has business in the Arcane Labyrinth after talking to the paragon of the Grippley. The party regroups with the caravan and continue on their way.
