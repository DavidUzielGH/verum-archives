# Strange Roads -- Session 01

## Relevant Lore

Five adventurers arrive in the city of Steel Ring in northern Daborak, drawn to the homely city for reasons ranging from hiring a carriage west to seeking a lead on a certain red-clad murderer. Regardless of their reason for coming, each of the five adventurers find themselves being hired by an charming elf named Jaquier to search a nearby deserter camp for evidence that would prove one of the members of Jaquier's tribe to be not-guilty of an unjustly accused crime. On the way to the deserter camp, the party stumbles upon the curious corpse of a member of the Mage's Guild and meets a tiny Taltaken wizard named Beryl. Beryl, finding himself newly without a master, decides to tag along on the party's mission. The party goes on to approach the deserter camp head-on, and succeeds in clearing them out with a decisive blow to the camp's leader.
