### The End of Beryl

> **Arcadum**: As you raise your staff above your head and focus upon the tapestry, you begin to slowly reweave the threads, you shift them quickly much like trying to stop an errant train and changing its direction. You try to lead this violet malfeasance somewhere safer, somewhere where it might dissipate out completely. As you attempt to do so the threads shift and change, you strain with difficulty.
>
> Everyone else you see that Arcidamus is sweating, his normal drunken shenanigans, off-put by the seriousness of this task, his staff cracks and shifts under the weight of the power of fate.
>
> But Arcidamus is but mortal, and The Enemy- The Enemy is watching. It breaks through into the fateless section. Immediately Beryl falls to the ground, his metallic body fades into violet dust, leaving behind only a single cog wheel. Redoubling his efforts Arcidamus focuses on the empty space, able to cordon it off from the others, quarantine it. Having nowhere else to go the maleficence begins to dissipate outwards, but not before revealing something to the cleric of Fate.

(Wisdom Saving throw for Arcidamus: `19`)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, to the empty nothing you see an open eye and with it you gaze directly through to the other side. You see it then. The visage of a great wizard. Its robes coiling into three different tendrils. A point of light at each one. Around it a light, like that of a circle, with another point of light moving. As it orbits around the wizard you can see with each step prismatic stones pop from the circle. You then see further out from that. The roar of a great beast nebulas away and further ahead, even further, just beyond sight, you see The Herald burning with violet light. Something waits behind it though, its name- a title, no- a purpose, you feel the presence of your goddess pull you back from such sight. Her silent guiding hand throwing you back into the mortal realm. Within your hand something is there that was not once before. A shred of cloth etched in a golden accent like it was torn from a page of some book and you see the words, "Twilight Station."
>
> The party sees Berylâ€™s body fade into violet dust and all that remains, as I said ,is a single cog wheel. It seems different from the rest of his makeup. The cogwheel is black and etched in red veins. It seems pulsing in some manner, like it is an organism of some kind, before finally it settles. And that is what happens, what do you do?

(Discussions occur, they decide to inspect the cog wheel.)

> **Arcadum**: As you look at the cog more closely (Dodger uses Zach's Eyes of the Rune Keeper) you can see the text written on it is not esoteric, but rather means something- around the gear, the cog you see, "I walked each of the nine paths as best I could, but the tenth I could not. Use this to seal that which may never be seen."

(History rolls after revealing that this might be in reference to the Sage of the Nine Paths)

> **Arcadum**: As you grab the cog and lift it up, it shifts and changes its form, and it becomes like that of a key. The key is black and red with veins and it ends with serrated teeth.

`Cog of the First`, is the name of the key.
