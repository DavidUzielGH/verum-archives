# Strange Roads -- Session 02

## Relevant Lore

Having cleared out the deserter camp, the party is able to find the necessary evidence to prove Jaquir's tribesman not-guilty. While searching the camp, the party discovers Beryl's ability to evolve upon receiving outside stimuli, and Koordrin decides to test this ability by feeding Beryl one of the deserter's fingers. Beryl evolves into the shape of a humanoid, with a metal body and screen-like face. The party, shaken and divided by this development, takes the evidence they came to find and returns to the city. Jaquier is overjoyed to hear their success and invites them all to the Starlight Carnival put on by Jaquir's traveling circus, promising to speak with them again after they enjoy themselves. The party attends the carnival, meeting a slew of interesting characters, including a fortune teller whom Beryl decides to go see alongside Mirage and Arcidamus. The fortune teller tries to read Beryl's fortune, but sees nothing, followed by a flash of violet light. As a cleric of fate, Arcidamus hangs behind to console the fortune teller as the rest go on to enjoy the carnival. Eventually it comes time for the main act, but it is cut short by a blood-curdling scream.
