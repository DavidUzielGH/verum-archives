# Strange Roads -- Session 03

## Relevant Lore

The party goes to investigate the scream they heard at the end of the last session to find that people in the streets have been exploding into fonts of blood at random. One such person to have been killed was a man that the party talked to briefly in previous episodes, and they are called to the longhouse of the Lord Commander. Being the last people to be seen with this man, the party is called into suspicion, and is charged with clearing their own names by finding out who really killed this man. The party finds out that the thing killing random people might be some sort of plague, and receives a lead from the longhouse's maid to inspect the longhouse's basement. In the basement, the party discovers a hidden crypt which they explore, some members stealing from several urns along the way. Eventually, after doing some pillaging and disrupting what appeared to be a small necromancy ritual, the party makes their way to the crypt's main chamber. The face off against the maid they met before who is revealed to be the necromancer responsible for the recent deaths around town. The party defeats her and inspects the tomb in the middle of the room. Upon approaching, Zacharius's dice begin to shake as the Gambler Black demands that Zacharius roll them. He does so covertly and reaps the rewards, and ultimately the party leaves the crypt successful.
