### A Translator's Final Words

Having just spoken with the leaders of the various Orc tribes in the Badlands the party moves to the front of the camp and a strange person approaches:

> **Rezakaro**: Listen to me well, my friends. What we have to discuss cannot be repeated, not to the orcs, nor to any other. It would seem that the undulations of fate have determined that it is your ears that will hear these words. So be it.<br>
**Ives**: I’m sorry, the what?<br>
**Rezakaro**: The undulations of fate.<br>
**Turr Khei**: What’s an undulation?<br>

(Antonius martial checks Rezakaro: `15`)

> **Arcadum**: He does not seem that powerful, but his wisdom is unmistakable. You believe him to be a noncombatant, though.

> **Morc**: How did you find us?<br>
**Rezakaro**: It is time. The pieces have begun to fall into place. The star begins to shatter. One of my brothers has already been killed--an unfortunate setback, and no doubt the enemy is already moving against us. Listen carefully to next of what I say. You ally has been gifted--or cursed, I suppose--with the sight. There are seven that will see and once the seventh sees, it will begin. With each passing moment the Herald grows closer and we have not the means to face them. One such that sees moves with their comrades towards the Shadow of the wizard Tyre and it is you that shall face the Heart.<br>
**Turr Khei**: Wh- what’s the Heart?<br>
**Antonius**: What is the Shadow of Tyre?<br>
**Morc**: Who is Tyre?<br>
**Rezakaro**: Tyre is a wizard of great power, a traitor to my cause. Once a brother he was and a traitor he ever shall remain, but his power is needed if we are to assist you to face what it to come. The great Wheel turns and that which was will be so again, but the Seven are not here; you are here. The Herald beckons and it will be those- it will be those of you that answer the call.

(Antonius, Ives, and Turr Khei do insight checks: `22`, `19`, and `8`)

> **Arcadum**: Your insight reveals that the man is panicked, fearful. He constantly shifts his gaze, looking up towards the sky as if measuring the Herald’s minute movements. He is obviously afraid, but he has conviction in what he is doing. You do not believe he is trying to deceive you.

> **Morc**: The thing that once was… was it that- that gate that I saw?<br>
**Antonius**: What?<br>
**Morc**: In my vision I saw a gate, something that was being repaired. It flowed with energy.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Yes. What you speak of is the Shattered Gate, but you are not ready for that. You lack the strength. You will need strength in order to see and I am to be your guide.<br>
**Antonius**: Are you alone?<br>
**Rezakaro**: There are others of my order, although with one to be traded, I cannot see. A traitorous one and a death of another, there are not many that yet remain.<br>
**Antonius**: How knowledgeable are you on this great threat? We still have very little understanding of it, but we all feel its threat.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Indeed. My purpose, my order is dedicated to the translation of the knowledge required to face such a being with the understanding that with each nugget of wisdom you receive, the power of the threat grows. It is my duty to determine what costs of knowledge are worth so that you may choose your own path, but the first is that you must face the Heart. For without the Heart, the Shadow will fail, and the Soul will have no recourse.<br>
**Antonius**: What is the Heart?<br>
**Rezakaro**: There is a great labyrinth within the Sickened Sea, a labyrinth of arcane power. It is where Tyre can be found. There are pieces that Tyre possesses that must be acquired. It is the only way to cross the Astral Sea, that the Herald might be stopped, but Tyre is mad with power and a traitor to my order. He will not give, so we must take.<br>
**Antonius**: Assuming we are all successful with this, what does this translate into? Does this translate into us being able to even interact with this enemy, who I heard we should not be speaking of, and yet you keep repeatedly saying his name, is that not dangerous?<br>
**Rezakaro**: I am already lost. My words can be spoken, but others cannot.

> **Arcadum**: And with that, he will pull back his hood and reveal that the entire top part of his head is covered in violet veins and is rotted nearly completely away. He will then put his hood back down, and will say:

> **Rezakaro**: This was the cost that I may serve you.<br>
***Morc** grabs at his eye.<br>
**Morc**: Oh god…<br>
**Turr Khei**: Are you gonna be like that, dad?<br>
**Morc**: If I must be to contain this evil, then yes.<br>
**Antonius**: So what do we- what do we do?<br>
**Rezakaro**: First we must speak, then we must plan, and then you will need to make difficult choices. I am here to see that you are informed, but I can make no decision. I cannot be trusted to do so.<br>
**Ives**: Why not?<br>
**Morc**: Do you trust not even yourself?<br>
**Rezakaro**: The knowledge that I give you is controlled and contorted, but to give me power of direction mean that your cause could be corrupted.<br>
***Rezakaro** gestures to the top of his head.<br>
**Antonius**: How are we to trust that the nuggets that you are giving us now is of a benevolent purpose, if you claim to be corrupted.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Our enemy is... A fact can be no more than a fact and a lie it cannot be, but how it will be used, that is very subjective. It is why you are the ones that shall decide, and not I.<br>
**Antonius**: Well, what are the options?<br>
**Rezakaro**: First, we will speak of your goals. The first in which I speak to, is you, bearer of the cursed sight. You visions revealed to you the fate of your people, did they not?<br>
**Morc**: They did. I saw them again, enslaved by a machine.<br>
**Arcadum**: The man will grip the staff that he holds, and then he will speak.<br>
**Rezakaro**: It will be difficult for you to hear, but their fate must come to pass. Its prevention will put you in the wrong place. You cannot see, you cannot be, and therefore it may fail. The Wheel will complete its turn and all shall be lost.<br>
**Morc**: My people cannot be saved…<br>
**Rezakaro**: They can, but at the cost of all.<br>
**Ives**: The Wheel can complete its turn… what you’re talking about is breaking a cycle?<br>
**Rezakaro**: In a way. More so not allowing it ever to be completed, for the Wheel turns only once. The Seven stopped it before, but their power wanes, their protection temporary.<br>
**Ives**: So they’re a stop gap.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Indeed, and now the torch must be passed.<br>
**Antonius**: Wait so, all the stories we’ve heard about the Seven- they didn’t actually stop the Herald, they just paused it?<br>
**Rezakaro**: Would it be so that they did-<br>
**Morc**: Or did they reset it?<br>
**Rezakaro**: You have the right idea, bearer. To stop such a thing would be to stop the turning of the Wheel, which cannot be done, so the Wheel was reset, and thus it begins again.<br>
**Ives**: Reset?<br>
**Seren**: So the goal is never to stop the Herald, it’s to keep resetting the Wheel?<br>
**Rezakaro**: Indeed.<br>
**Turr Khei**: We need to take it off the track finally, instead of just letting it continue to roll.<br>
**Antonius**: We can’t do that.

(Recalls that Death’s Herald told him the Wheel turning is necessary for the order of the universe)

> **Antonius**: So the Herald is a necessary part of the universe?<br>
**Rezakaro**: No. It is a sickness, a sickness that can never be removed. Would it be that is is believed that all the manners of laws that control and contort our universe would be without folly or fault, but they are not. It is imperfect, and as such, susceptible to such sickness, and such sickness it received.<br>
**Antonius**: So the Herald is essentially a tumor attached to a heart?<br>
**Ives**: Antonius.<br>
**Antonius**: Yeah?<br>
**Ives**: That’s three times now. He can say it, you can’t.<br>
**Antonius**: Shit… I-<br>
**Rezakaro**: Fear not. I am prepared for such things.

> **Arcadum**: And you will see one of his fingers fall away and turn to violet dust.

> **Antonius**: Oh… sorry about that…<br>
**Rezakaro**: It is fine. We must speak. It is with good reason that you speak only its title and not its name.<br>
**Antonius**: It has a name?<br>
**Rezakaro**: Of course it does. But never-<br>
**Antonius**: Can you spell it out?<br>
**Rezakaro**: No.<br>
**Seren**: I don’t think it’s a good idea to know that.<br>
**Antonius**: True.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Listen to this. Listen to me-<br>
**Morc**: This is why the orcs must not know. I understand now.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Its- its title bears power and weight, but its name- its name is a wrongness that when uttered will doom us all.<br>
**Antonius**: Are there people alive that know this name?<br>
**Rezakaro**: There are some, but they know the power that they wield. Some have chosen isolation, others service, and some bind themselves within the Cardinal.<br>
**Seren**: The Cardinal? What’s that?<br>
**Rezakaro**: The Cardinal is the first guardian. The Cardinal is the guiding spirit of the Seven. The Cardinal was the first.<br>
**Morc**: Is he afflicted like you and I?<br>
**Rezakaro**: The Cardinal has been lost for some time.<br>
**Morc**: I see.<br>
**Turr Khei**: Why is it so human when it is supposed to be dietic? If they’re dietic why do they make falsities? That’s not how it should have been. They’re fallible.<br>
**Rezakaro**: What you speak of is the reflection. ‘Tis the corrupting method. It is why that such things must be safeguarded. The Cyclops have begun to awaken and those that see walk with them. They prepare for the Shadow, but now you must prepare for the Heart. The decisions that you make within these next few moments will determine your entire fate. There are many- many things that will transpire through the sacrifice. It is my duty to reveal its cost. Your people- your people must suffer the chains for you to be there Madd M…- Madd Morc.

> **Arcadum**: You notice as he says you name he says them with difficulty. Make me an insight check.

(All roll insight, highest is Seren: `30`)

> **Arcadum**: With a 30, Seren, you are able to identify this very important piece of knowledge: Each time that the individual references one of you, there is a sudden shake of his head as if he is attempting to forget it as it is spoken. When saying the full name, when saying Madd Morc, the grip on his staff tightens and his knuckles turn white.

> **Antonius**: Wait. Thinking of circles and wheels and cycles- Do you know what happens to us?<br>
**Rezakaro**: I know- I know not of what happens to you, but what will happen if you are not you. If you take up this mantle and you walk the path of the Seven, I can see what you lose and as it is that I must tell you. You must know what is given so that you may know the value of what is taken.

> **Arcadum**: And you see that as he says this he grips his staff even more so. Tears stream down his face as if he is living your sorrow that you have yet to suffer.

(Antonius tries to place a hand on Rezakaro’s shoulder)

 >**Arcadum**: As you reach out to place a hand on his shoulder he will back away and raise up his hand.

> **Rezakaro**: You must never risk to touch me. My body is broken. Your health- you must be pure. Please- your sentiment, your kindness is appreciated but wasted, for I have accepted my fate. I am but your servant and guide for as long as I yet stand. Now, I must tell the others.
***Rezakaro** turns towards Neve.
>
> **Rezakaro**: If uncontrolled, you mother’s hatred will consume all the people- all the people of the islands to the north of the great white city. I see her now. She takes- she takes from them their hearts and their eyes.<br>
**Neve**: She will die. Do you know where exactly she is?<br>
**Rezakaro**: I am sorry, but if you are to stand the path of the Seven, she will not.<br>
**Morc**: Do you see her fate as well?<br>
**Rezakaro**: If you face your mother, she will die, but you will not return.<br>
**Neve**: And what of those people? Is there no way to save them?<br>
**Arcadum**: He will grip the staff. Tears will stream down his face.<br>
**Rezakaro**: It is the cost the Seven must face.<br>
**Neve**: And the rest of the world I will carry this weight.<br>
**Turr Khei**: You’re a good person. Don’t forget that.<br>
>
> ***Rezakaro**: turns towards Ives.<br>
**Rezakaro** The guilt that you carry, assassin, its burden upon you--I can see it. Redemption can be yours, for there is but a shrine- a shrine where someone waits. If you find them, you will know your peace. You will be freed from your guilt.<br>
**Ives**: A shrine? What shrine?<br>
**Rezakaro**: To the south, within Steton. A shrine to the silent watcher, to The Crow-Father, to lord Vavren. Someone waits for you, someone whose face is familiar and whose forgiveness will free you, but you mustn’t go, for if you do your peace will be temporary as your life- as the Wheel will turn and though you may stand for noble causes, nothing more noble than creation. Your guilt will never fade and I fear that within the Heart of Tyre, you may lose yourself to it.
>
> ***Rezakaro** turns to Turr Khei.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Paladin. I see them. The souls weigh heavy on your mind, those trapped within cages by those that care not for the cost of them. The Dream Realm has many nightmares and many more whose lives have been stolen. To walk from this path would see you free them. So many souls returned to the life stream, until it is severed completely. To walk the path of The Seven, you would but leave them to their suffering.<br>
**Turr Khei**: I uh… I feel that at this moment I… I need a moment to set aside my pride, because I know that I want to do the right thing, even if it’s doing bad for a little bit. In my heart it’s the right thing. Okay I guess I didn’t need that much time.
>
> ***Rezakaro**: turns to Seren.<br>
**Rezakaro**: And to you, green warden, snow blossom, caller of the arctic wind. The Fey Wild needs you. The Alice awaits you. You could have it, if you desired, to stand with the Silent Guardians and walk with them until the end. Should you walk the path of The Seven you will never see Derick again. I am sorry.<br>
**Seren**: It’s- [cuts out] -deserve better anyway.<br>
**Rezakaro**: [Whispers] But he won’t find it.
>
> ***Rezakaro** turns to Antonius.<br>
**Rezakaro**: To stray- to stray from the path you would see the planes of this world united. Abbadon, the heavens, years of prosperity before it all ends. The Bastion will be broken. To walk the path of The Seven you will lose yourself again. You will be a man with no home, no name. I fear you will wander all the rest of your days.<br>
**Antonius**: Will the world survive?<br>
**Rezakaro**: If you do not fail, the Wheel will reset.<br>
**Turr Khei**: I guess we better not fail.<br>
**Antonius**: Then it is no question.<br>
**Rezakaro**: So be it. If you wish to walk this path you shall lose much.<br>
**Morc**: We will walk the path of The Seven.<br>
**Antonius**: Has this happened to me before?<br>

> **Arcadum**: The man will squeeze his staff, but will say nothing.

> **Antonius**: I understand more about my past than ever now and yet you’ve told me nothing.<br>
**Morc**: Antonius, do you not remember when we defeated the White Widow and we gripped that key?<br>
**Antonius**: So much is making sense to me. The nature of cycles and wheels turning…<br>
**Turr Khei**: We just gotta break it.

(Seren contemplates not being as good as past lives, Neve scolds and reassures her)

> **Antonius**: Well, if doing this- I woke up once wandering, as you just said, and it led me to this, and it’s leading me to defeating the enemy, so if that’s the punishment I can bear, I’ve experienced it and I can do it.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Very well. Now to the path. Before you may venture to the Heart of Tyre there is one task you must complete. Your te- your strength must be tested. You must- (*gasps*) You must face the knowledge that I hold and then you must defeat a face from the past. He that was wronged hunts you now. With each passing day his hatred gets him closer. The Herald whispers in his ear and leads him to you. Your assassin failed.

(All question who it could be, then Turr Khei starts freaking out as they all remember. Neve asks if that means Agent Olive died.)

> **Arcadum**: The translator does not answer that question, but grips his staff tightly.

(The party continues to grill Turr Khei on why he as a paladin would hire an assassin)

> **Antonius**: What was your name, I’m sorry?<br>
**Rezakaro**: My name is Rezakaro Redsun.<br>
**Antonius**: Well, Rezakaro, this- this enemy that hunts us, is he actually connected to the great enemy in some way?<br>
**Morc**: He is being whispered to.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Yes. His hatred for you is being mis- controlled, and-<br>
**Ives**: Are you alright?<br>
**Rezakaro**: I- (*gasps*)<br>

> **Arcadum**: The man leans on his staff.

**Morc**: Don’t touch him.<br>
**Rezakaro**: The- The Herald listens, watches, and waits for me to slip at any moment. You must face this challenge. You must sever this line. You must unravel this thread. When your hated enemy is slain, the way will become clear to you, and you may enter the Heart of Tyre.

(Turr Khei tries to help him and he leans away, falling on the ground)

**Rezakaro**: You mustn’t touch me!<br>
**Turr Khei**: Okay fine, I was just trying. You seem sad. I hate it.<br>
**Antonius**: Are- are you going to be okay, friend? Well, relatively.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Your concern for me is touching, but you must prepare for what is to come. The enemy that- (*chokes*) this Hoto, his rage-<br>
**Antonius**: Where do we find this Hoto?<br>
**Rezakaro**: He will be here in a few days. He is close. Once you face him, the dominoes shall fall, and your path- your path will be (*chokes*) secured. Prepare yourselves to walk the path of The Seven and to face this enemy. Say your goodbyes, for once the battle is done, you leave your lives behind.

(The party laments what could have been and grapples with the greater good)

**Antonius**: Are there any preparations we should make? You seem to be very familiar with this enemy. Is there anything of that nature, that corruption that we should look for? Can we defend against it? Can we prepare?<br>
**Morc**: Can we sever it from this man?<br>
**Rezakaro**: I do not know. I can look if you’d like, but it will be costly.<br>
**Antonius**: No. You’ve suffered enough.<br>
**Turr Khei**: All the answers we can gain we can gain from our own actions, not through your suffering.<br>
**Rezakaro**: Very well. Sleep well. Eat well. Life what little life you can of your pasts, for on the third morning, the warrior arrives, and your fate is no longer your own.<br>
**Turr Khei**: And where does your thread lead?<br>

> **Arcadum**: A wistful smile will appear on his face as he says:

> **Rezakaro**: My thread has already been lived, my friend.<br>

(Turr Khei attempts to do an air high five. Rezakaro lets it hang, as he doesn’t know what that is. Turr Khei then invites him to stay at the Bastion.)

> **Rezakaro**: I thank you for the offer, but I must never go to where your home is.<br>
**Turr Khei**: Oh. Why is that?<br>

> **Arcadum**: He points to the top of his head.

(Turr Khei suggests they give him Antonius’ apartment in Bleak. Others point out it’s too far. The conversation turns back to the Bastion and the translator walks away. Morc attempts to look at his violet eye in the reflection of Neve’s jade scimitar and he hobbles back over to use his staff to knock it from Morc’s hand.)

> **Rezakaro**: No! No- no, you musn’t. You must never look upon a surface that you can see, for if you see it, it sees it, and it sees you.

(Seren helps Morc place bandages over his eye)

> **Morc**: I will heed your warning, wizard.<br>
**Antonius**: Wait does- does that mean if the enemy can see Morc, Morc can- wait, can this be used to our advantage somehow? I’m not saying we will, but can that give us information?<br>
**Morc**: I did see four visions when the eye appeared. Through like, someone else’s body. Strange. First I was a bird and I was helping someone with a curse or with a sickness. Strange. And then it changed, and I was on top of a cliff. I was looking into the ocean for an enemy and I had a bow in my hand.<br>
***Morc** looks at Ives.<br>
**Morc**: And after that it changed again and I was surrounded by a group of friends. I- I- I don’t know who they are, all I know is they were nobles of flowing water, and my skin was deathly grey, kinda like Turr Khei’s when he was a vampire, and one of my allies was standing with a mirror, and then that’s when I saw the final vision, the one with the Gate. Somebody or something was trying to fix it.<br>
**Antonius**: Well, it’s good to know that if circumstances are dire we can subject ourselves for more information, but I would probably advise against that for now.<br>
**Turr Khei**: So the uh, the gate you saw, was it uh, do we want that to be fixed, or…?<br>
***Morc** looks to Rezakaro.<br>
**Morc**: You mentioned it, that the enemy is repairing it, yes?<br>
**Rezakaro**: The Gate, if it is
***Rezakaro** chokes and falls to his knees.<br>
**Rezakaro**: This question I can answer, but it will be the last. Is this what you wish?<br>
**Antonius**: This isn’t vital information yet. We don’t need you to sacrifice yourself for it.

> **Arcadum**: He will nod and meekly get up to his feet again.

> **Antonius**: One more thing, and I don’t know if you have the answer for us, or if this will pain you please abstain from answering but, you mentioned a great wheel, and its only needing to be turned once and reset. That implies- hm. The enemy was not a part of this wheel always. Where did it come from?

> **Arcadum**: And with that… Okay, here we go. With that, the translator will begin to turn to dust, but he will speak.

> **Rezakaro**: You are correct. The Herald hails from another land, from other lands. Five times has the Wheel turned in other lands and now this one seeks to turn. The secret- a secret of The Herald and its weakness is hidden in its past. You must seek the Twilight Station.

(Rezakaro Redsun is turned to dust and blown away with the wind.)
