### A Violet Eye

Morc’s eyes were destroyed by a violet source and were then regenerated within a violet source. Something happens to his eyes:

> **Arcadum**: Morc, as your eyes are restored, before your true vision comes back you are shown the vision of something else.
>
> You find yourself standing in a strange building. You see a feathered hand reach out towards a sickly looking girl with a black shadow, inky and menacing etching out of it. Your feathered hand removes it from the creature pulling it free. There is another flash. You find yourself standing on serrated cliffs. You hold a bow in your hand and overlook across the ocean, trying to spot your enemy. There is another flash. You find yourself standing amongst your fellows. Lords, nobles of flowing water. Your skin is gray and your voice is soft, an ally stands above you holding up a mirror. You see it then, standing on the precipice of creation, a great gate swirling with astral power. Shattered. Something is trying to repair it. Your vision returns to the battle at hand and your mind is your own once more.


### Sevenic Speech

(Session [timestamp](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/646081002?t=04h05m07s))

> **Arcadum**: Seven step forward. And thus, your courage shines like a light against the violet. Behind you manifested in the shadows, Rannic returns. The great beast lets forth a silent roar as he smiles in great approval. His strength is not sufficient to save you; but it is strong enough to hold the door. With a great Saurian stomp, the way out is forged, back to the waking realm. And there he will hold the line. Take thy soul and run.

(*Rolling athletics to grab the oracle’s soul*)

> **Arcadum**: Together your courage shines. You run straight at the servant, straight towards the Oracle’s soul. The creature squints its eyes and bares its teeth. It seems that you will not roll over and die like others. But it has dealt with your kind before. Heroes don’t last long.
>
> The Cataclysmic Parable will roll it’s own athletics check. Should it defeat your roll `(21)`, one of you shall suffer Violet Death.

(*Rolls a nat 20. Morc is chosen for death*)

> **Arcadum**: The Cataclysmic Parable opens its great maw. Its teeth shining with violet oblivion. Morc shines with the power of Iass and brings back his blade.

(*Clash roll #1. Morc wins by 2*)

> **Arcadum**: The creature’s maw descends down upon Madd Morc as he lifts his blade and parries the creature's teeth. There is a clash of light and the sound of ringing steel. For a moment the dream realm shakes. But the orc does not fall. Not yet. The voices of The Seven echo in the distance. And as such, he holds the line.

(*Athletics check #2 `(19)`*)

> **Arcadum**: The rest of the group is able to move forward and grasp the Oracle’s soul. The song of The Seven rises up in a great crescendo. The enemy cries out, it’s voice unheard. It’s eyes burning with hatred. It will not be stopped. Especially not by a pretender, a torch holder, a mortal. 

(*Clash roll #2. Morc wins by 12*)

> **Arcadum**: But you hold the line. Power rises up from Iass directly through your chest and body. Your skin, no longer a shade of green, but a bright shining grey. Your hair shifts from it’s color of brown to a golden mane. Madd Morc holds the line. The rest of you retreat with the soul intact. As you flee past Rannic he will hold the door and look with solemn eyes. For now you are locked with the creature, but can you escape?

 (*Athletics check `(14)` & clash #3 `(nat 20)`*)
 
 > **Arcadum**: And your fate... is determined. With one great swing, your weapon slashes against the creatures maw. It’s teeth crack. The force of Iass pulls you away. Defiant you look upon it with eyes, challenging and unshakable. The creature will not forget Madd Morc.
 
 (*General talk until the form of Iass fades..*)
 
 > **Arcadum**: Rannic will then stand at the gate. The great violet creature looks down and it seems that they share a conversation. The creature smiles and mocks Rannic. Rannic, the great Saurian’s eyes are sorrowful. He knows what is to come. But they harden into steel. No matter how the wind howls, the mountain does not bend to it. The archdruid of the past will look behind him and will nod at Seren and will close the gate.
